It quickly became the biggest money-making film of all time and changed the shape of the film industry. After two successful sequels (1980s The Empire Strikes Back and 1983s Return of the Jedi) that extended the story of the first film, Lucas took some time off to produce movies for others, with mixed success. In 1999, Lucas returned to the Star Wars saga with a new approach -- instead of picking up where Return of the Jedi left off, Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace would be the first of a trilogy of stories to trace what happened in the intergalactic saga before the first film began. Here, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) is a young apprentice Jedi knight under the tutelage of Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson); Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd), who will later father Luke Skywalker and become known as Darth Vader, is just a nine-year-old boy. When the Trade Federation cuts off all routes to the planet Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan are assigned to settle the matter, but when they arrive on Naboo they are brought to Amidala (Natalie Portman), the Naboo queen, by a friendly but opportunistic Gungan named Jar Jar. Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan plan to escort Amidala to a meeting of Republic leaders in Coruscant, but trouble with their spacecraft strands them on the planet Tatooine, where Qui-Gon meets Anakin, the slave of a scrap dealer. Qui-Gon is soon convinced that the boy could be the leader the Jedis have been searching for, and he begins bargaining for his freedom and teaching the boy the lessons of the Force. The supporting cast includes Pernilla August as Anakins mother, Terence Stamp as Chancellor Valorum, and Samuel L. Jackson as Jedi master Mace Windu.

24,30,The Outrage,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Derived from Rashomon, the classic 1951 Japanese film, The Outrage attempts to modernize the original story of rape and murder, transporting from medieval Japan to the American Southwest of the 1870s. The story is told within the framework of three men waiting at a railway station. A con-man (Edward G. Robinson) listens to the account of a trial held recently in the town as told by a prospector (Howard Da Silva) and a preacher (William Shatner) suffering from a crisis of faith in humanity. Three witnesses at the trial of a Mexican outlaw give conflicting testimony. Each version is shown in flashback. The outlaw, Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman), confesses that he bound the husband (Laurence Harvey), raped the wife, and killed the husband in a duel of honor. The wife (Claire Bloom) claims that the outlaw raped her, and then she stabbed her husband when he contemptuously blamed her for inviting the assault. The third witness, an old Indian (Paul Fix), declares that he found the dying husband who stated that he stabbed himself because he couldnt live with the humiliation. At this point, the narrative is interrupted by an abandoned babys cry. The child has gold hidden in his clothing which the con-man attempts to appropriate. Then the discussion of the trial continues, turning brusquely from drama to parody. The prospector admits that he witnessed the rape, but that the wife nagged the two men into fighting over her. The husband tripped and fell on his own knife. The prospector, who stole the jeweled knife from the dead body, chose not to appear in court. Possibly out of some desire for redemption, the prospector decided to care for the abandoned baby, and the preacher regains faith from the supposed altruistic action. The eerily deserted train station and the strong black-and-white cinematography contribute a mild surreal quality to the film, but can do little to save the story from its flaws. The changes in the characters necessary to accommodate the new setting cause them to lose important symbolic significance in the translation. Despite a star cast and strong acting, the new version is mediocre at best.

Waifish Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), move into the Bramford, an old New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and only elderly residents. Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemarys reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast, the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castevets circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth, and the baby is taken away from her. Polanskis camerawork and Richard Sylberts production design transform the realistic setting (shot on-location in Manhattans Dakota apartment building) into a sinister projection of Rosemarys fears, chillingly locating supernatural horror in the familiar by leaving the most grotesque frights to the viewers imagination. This apocalyptic yet darkly comic paranoia about the hallowed institution of childbirth touched a nerve with late-60s audiences feeling uneasy about traditional norms. Produced by B-horror maestro William Castle, Rosemarys Baby became a critically praised hit, winning Gordon an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Inspiring a wave of satanic horror from The Exorcist (1973) to The Omen (1976), Rosemarys Baby helped usher in the genres modern era by combining a supernatural story with Alfred Hitchcocks propensity for finding normality horrific. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi","R (adult situations/language, violence)","Classics, Horror, Mystery & Suspense",Roman Polanski,Paramount Pictures,136 minutes,"Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Ruth Gordon"

Based on the acclaimed novel by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, published posthumously in 1958 and subsequently translated into all European languages, the picture opens as Salina (Burt Lancaster) learns that Garibaldis troops have embarked in Sicily. While the Prince sees the event as an obvious threat to his current social status, his opportunistic nephew Tancredi (Alain Delon) becomes an officer in Garibaldis army and returns home a war hero. Tancredi starts courting the beautiful Angelica (Claudia Cardinale), a daughter of the towns newly appointed Mayor, Don Calogero Sedara (Paolo Stoppa). Though the Prince despises Don Calogero as an upstart who made a fortune on land speculation during the recent social upheaval, he reluctantly agrees to his nephews marriage, understanding how much this alliance would mean for the impecunious Tancredi. Painfully realizing the aristocracys obsolescence in the wake of the new class of bourgeoisie, the Prince later declines an offer from a governmental emissary to become a senator in the new Parliament in Turin. The closing section, an almost hour-long ball, is often cited as one of the most spectacular sequences in film history. Burt Lancaster is magnificent in the first of his patriarchal roles, and the rest of the cast, especially Delon and Cardinale, become almost perfect incarnations of the novels characters. Filmed in glorious Techniscope and rich in period detail, the film is a remarkable cinematic achievement in all departments.

However, on June 16, 1959, to the shock of many, Reeves was found dead of a gunshot wound.

Simo found that many Hollywood insiders did not care to cooperate as he researched the Reeves case, but his digging uncovered plenty of evidence suggesting the actor did not take his own life, and he also revealed one of Reeves deepest secrets -- while he was engaged to marry a pretty young starlet, Leonore Lemmon (Robin Tunney), Reeves was also carrying on an affair with the beautiful Toni Mannix (Diane Lane), the wife of Eddie Mannix (Bob Hoskins), a powerful and ill-tempered executive at MGM.

Even with all his surveillance talent, however, Jack cannot see (or hear) how dangerous the big picture really is until its too late. Taking a break from horror films, De Palma turned his interests in technology and voyeurism toward more politically loaded subject matter at the dawn of the Reagan era; the films red, white and blue mise-en-scène, ""Liberty Day"" celebration climax, and conspiracy surrounding political ""dirty tricks"" suggest that American politics are still rotten, seven years after Watergate. Although Blow Out earned some favorable notice, particularly for Travoltas first ""adult"" performance, De Palmas downbeat film did not go over well with 1981 summer audiences. Rather than blockbuster escapism, Blow Out instead harks back to 1970s political thrillers like The Parallax View (1974), using cinematic fireworks to tell an unsettling story about one mans struggle against unstoppable corruption. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi",R,Mystery & Suspense,Brian DePalma,Filmways Pictures,107 minutes,"John Travolta, Nancy Allen, John Lithgow"

Correctly assuming his cast and crew would be wary of such a journey, Denham has told them theyre traveling to Singapore, but before they set sail, his leading lady drops out of the project. Needing a beautiful actress willing to take a risk, Denham finds Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), a beautiful but down-on-her-luck vaudeville performer, and offers her the role; cautious but eager to work, Darrow takes the role, and onboard the ship she strikes up a romance with Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody), a respected playwright hired by Denham to write the script for his latest epic.When Denham and company arrive on Skull Island, the natives react with savage violence, but they happen to be the least of their worries. Skull Island is a sanctuary for prehistoric life, and lording it over the dinosaurs and other giant beasts is Kong, a 25-foot-tall gorilla who can outfight any creature on Earth.
