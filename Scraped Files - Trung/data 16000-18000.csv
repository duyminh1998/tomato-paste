The first of these rehashes was El Dorado, with Rio Bravo star John Wayne back for more. Wayne plays a gunfighter who rides into El Dorado to link up with his old pal, sheriff Robert Mitchum (""Its the big one with the big two!"" declared the films advertisements). Wayne has turned down a job with evil land baron Ed Asner, whod hoped to drive a family off the land that he needed for its water. That family, headed by R.G. Armstrong, is convinced that Wayne is working with Asner; when Armstrongs son Johnny Crawford dies, Wayne is held responsible, earning him a bullet in the spine from Crawfords sister Michele Carey. A year passes: Wayne returns to El Dorado, in the company of his new saddle pal James Caan. They find that Asner is still up to his old tricks, and that Mitchum has descended into alcoholism. Several plot twists and power shifts ensue, leading to the slam-bang climax, with the partially paralyzed Wayne, the newly crippled Mitchum (on crutches), and the concussion-suffering Caan battling together to stave off Asners minions. The final long-shot, of Wayne and Mitchum limping off together arm-in-arm, is one of the most enduring images in the entire Hawks canon. If they loved it twice theyll love it thrice: in 1969, John Wayne and Howard Hawks teamed up for a third Rio Bravo derivation, Rio Lobo--which, like the first two films, was scripted by Leigh Brackett.

In True Grit, Wayne plays grumpy, pot-bellied U.S. marshal ""Rooster"" Cogburn, hired by 14-year-old Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) to find Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), who killed her father. The headstrong Mattie could have had her pick of lawmen, but selects the aging Cogburn because she believes he has ""true grit"" (she talks this way all through the picture, so be prepared). Also heading into Indian territory in search of Chaney is Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Glen Campbell), who wants to collect the reward placed on the fugitives head for his earlier crimes. Complicating matters are Chaneys scurrilous cronies Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall), Quincy (Jeremy Slate), and Moon (Dennis Hopper), who have no qualms about killing a troublesome teenaged girl like Mattie. While the plot of True Grit, adapted (and streamlined) by Marguerite Roberts from the novel by Charles Portis, maintains audience interest throughout, the glue that truly holds this Western together is John Wayne, delivering one of his finest performances (though some believe he was better in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon). Waynes casual charisma is infinitely more effective than the mannered method acting of Kim Darby and the floundering non-acting of poor Glen Campbell. And who could not love the climatic face-off between Duvall and company and John Wayne, whose ""Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!"" is not only a classic bit of dialogue, but the apotheosis of the Wayne mystique.

The film premiered to critical acclaim at the 2010 SXSW Film Festival, followed by a much-lauded screening at the 2010 Los Angeles Film Festival. After abandoning a promising academic career in forensic science, aimless Doug (Cris Lankenau) returns to Portland to live with his more responsible big sister Gail (Trieste Kelly). He quickly lands a dead-end job in an ice factory, but his latent passion for detective work is stoked when his ex-girlfriend goes missing. Armed with a handful of arcane clues, Doug enlists Gail and co-worker Carlos (Raúl Castillo) in a ramshackle investigation that draws the slacker sleuths into Portlands not-quite-seedy underground. Building on the lyrical style and naturalistic performances of his two previous features, DANCE PARTY USA and QUIET CITY, Katz offers a refreshingly idiosyncratic spin on genre conventions. He eschews the twisty plots and violence of modern neo-noir in favor of sly, deadpan humor and closely-observed performances. COLD WEATHER is simultaneously a story of a brother and sister getting to know each other after years apart and a mystery in the great tradition of crime and detective fiction. -- (C) IFC Films",NR,"Comedy, Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Aaron Katz (II),IFC Films,90 minutes,"Cris Lankenau, Trieste Kelly Dunn, Raul Castillo"

The boys love for the animal does not alter the fact that the fawn is eating all of the Baxters crops. Sadly, Pa tells Jody that he must kill the yearling before all their crops are destroyed. Jody cant bring himself to do this, so he sets the animal free in the wilds. Time and again, however, the yearling returns to the farm. Finally, Ma Baxter, whod been against having the fawn on the property in the first place, shoots and wounds the animal.

Phineas Flynn is the American chatterbox; Ferb Fletcher is British and taciturn. The television movie Across the 2nd Dimension takes their antics further afield--and spoofs the mania for 3-D. When their giant shuttlecock collides with a spy plane piloted by their pet Perry the Platypus, Phineas and Ferb crash land in the laboratory of Dr. Doofenshmirtz. With typical enthusiasm (and blithe unawareness), the boys help the evil scientist build an ""Otherdimensionator"" that transports them to an alternate world. As the complications multiply, Perry is forced to reveal that hes not just a pet who grinds his teeth: hes Agent P, part of a cadre dedicated to fighting Doofenshmirtzs schemes. Eventually things get sorted out with the help of the alternate versions of Phineas, Ferb, and their sister Candace. Across the 2nd Dimension is most engaging when it plays like an extended episode of the series, with plenty of humor, off-beat songs, and pop-culture references: Doofenshmirtz and his alternate counterpart perform a number about finally finding a partner as the Blues Brothers, the Lone Ranger and Tonto, and Lucy and Ethel in the candy factory. As is often the case with TV cartoons that morph into features (Hey Arnold, Doug), things occasionally get too big--the swarms of CG robots the alternate Doofenshmirtz dispatches really dont add anything to the story. But the filmmakers generally succeed in walking a fine line, remaining smart without becoming smart alecks.

From the second she arrives it is clear that she and her father do not have a conventional relationship. Dedra becomes so distraught and jealous that she kills herself. Westwood: Ginny Chen (Jamie Chung) and Chad Bower (Robert Hoffman) are a young couple in love.

West Hollywood: Geri (Peter Macdissi) and Tom (Anson Mount) are life partners, though they could not be more different. The two adopt a little girl from Africa named Mahogany (Tiara McKinney), but when the little girl doesnt meet their expectations of how they feel she should act, they abandon her in a state forest.

Sarah tracks down Robert G. Kane (Nick Stahl) to a local pizza place. Instead of turning him in, Sarah wants him to rape her again. The underlying story beneath Burning Palms five featured stories, is the different kinds of people who live in the unique neighborhoods that make up the entertainment capital of the world: Los Angeles. There have been previous films similar in design, but their separate storylines always intersect at the end. Burning Palms defies those expectations by keeping the stories separate and distinct.
