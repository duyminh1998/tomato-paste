With brothers Virgil (Sam Elliot) and Morgan (Bill Paxton), he arrives in Tombstone, Arizona intending to build his fortune. He discovers that long-time friend Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer) is there and that the town is run by a group of brutal outlaws called the Cowboys. Earp, frustrated with his laudanum-addicted wife, begins a romance with traveling stage actress Josephine Marcus (Dana Delany). Meanwhile, the Cowboys terrorize the citizens of Tombstone unchecked. When the town marshal is killed by a Cowboy, Earp steps in to prevent a lynching by an angry mob. He also refuses to hand the killer over to his fellows, beginning the enmity between the Cowboys and the Earp brothers. Virgil, overcome with guilt at doing nothing to help the Tombstone citizens, accepts the position of town marshal. With Wyatt and Morgan as his deputies, and the help of Doc, Virgil attempts to arrest several Cowboys, resulting in the famous OK Corral shoot-out. The Cowboys take revenge by ambushing two of the brothers and injuring Virgil and killing Morgan. The Earps leave town, apparently cowed. Wyatt returns, wearing the badge of a U.S. marshal, vowing to destroy every last Cowboy. He hunts them mercilessly, until the leader, Johnny Ringo (Michael Biehn) challenges Wyatt to a duel.

Unbeknownst to Gris, the device -- which resembles an ornate, gilded mechanical beetle -- houses an immortal parasite which will grant eternal life to its host.

To this end he employs his vain, brutish nephew Angel (Ron Perlman) to retrieve it for him.

The titular outlaw bunch, headed by ethical-in-his-fashion Pike (William Holden), continues staging violent bank robberies in their old, time-honored tradition. After a particularly brutal holdup in the town of San Rafael, the gang -- or whats left of it -- heads for the hills of Mexico, pursued by a posse led by Thornton (Robert Ryan), an old friend of Pikes. The gang discovers that the bank had been set up to be robbed by Thorntons railroad-executive boss Pat Harrigan (Albert Dekker), and that their booty consists of worthless metal washers. Meanwhile, the conscience-stricken Thornton seethes over Harrigans scheme, which has cost too many innocent lives, but he is powerless to leave the railroad barons employ lest he be sent back to jail. While hiding out in a Mexican village, the gang is engaged by corrupt general Emilio Fernandez to steal a huge shipment of guns from the U.S. Army. Like Thornton, Pike agrees against his will: his right-hand man Jaime Sanchez is being held hostage by Fernandez, who in turn is being manipulated by a pair of war-mongering German officers. More violence -- both justified and gratuitous -- follows, leading to a final blood-spattered confrontation between the Wild Bunch and s posse. For many years, no one audience was privy to a ""definitive"" version of The Wild Bunch. Peckinpahs 144-minute directors cut was butchered by Warner Bros. after its first press showing (curiously, the studio removed not only the gorier scenes, but also several motivational sequences, rendering much of the film incomprehensible). The 1981 reissue was restored to 141 minutes, but it wasnt until the advent of home video that the complete version was once more made available. Once considered the last word in cinematic bloodletting, The Wild Bunch is a model of decorum compared to what was to follow.","R (adult situations/language, nudity, violence)","Action & Adventure, Drama, Western",Sam Peckinpah,Warner Bros.

Based on Cornell Woolrichs novel I Married a Deadman (it has been filmed twice before as No Man of Her Own, starring Barbara Stanwyck and I Married a Shadow), Mrs. Winterbourne is comparable in general tone to the far more successful Sandra Bullock vehicle While You Were Sleeping (1995). Lake plays Connie Doyle, a small-town girl with big-city aspirations. Unfortunately she isnt long in the Big Apple before she hooks up with sleazy Steve DeCunzo (Loren Dean), a soulless user who impregnates and callously dumps the destitute Connie. Anxious to leave New York, she accidentally boards a Boston-bound train and encounters charming Hugh Winterbourne (Brendan Fraser) and his pregnant wife Patricia. Connie admires Patricias fabulous wedding ring and asks to try it on. Gracious Patricia hands it to the delighted Connie. At that moment the train crashes. Connie awakens in a hospital to discover that many died in the crash, including the Winterbournes. She is still wearing Patricias ring and this leads her to be mistaken for Patricia, whom the wealthy clan had never met. At first she tries to set them straight, but then she realizes that this family could provide her newborn son with a privileged, cushy life that she could never give on her own and so goes to the posh Winterbourne mansion to live. There she meets the salty, ailing house matriarch, Grace Winterbourne (Shirley MacLaine), a woman who continues to smoke and drink against her doctors wishes. A former reprobate (she had been a showgirl), Grace proves to be the only playful breeze in an stuffy, snooty family. Romance comes in the form of the late Hughs twin brother Bill (also played by Fraser), who begins falling. Seeing that she lacks the gentility of a woman of Patricias standing, he at first suspects her, but as time passes falls hard for good-hearted Connies rather coarse charms.","PG-13 (adult situations/language, violence)","Comedy, Romance",Richard Benjamin,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,106 minutes,"Shirley MacLaine, Ricki Lake, Brendan Fraser"

But look a little closer and you may find other emotions arising: distaste, shock, and maybe even outrage. Getting Away with Murder, attempts to be a frothy black comedy about the fate of an alleged Nazi war criminal accused of horrendous crimes against the Jews (interestingly, the word ""Jew"" only comes up a couple times, the filmmakers preferring the more generic term ""victim"" instead). But with no real underlying point, no sympathetic protagonist, and a story that offers no barbed insights into the potentially fascinating subjects of administering vigilante justice based on hearsay and the notion of atonement for wrongs done, the story becomes vapid, tasteless and offensive. Aykroyd plays Jack Lambert, a mild-mannered professor of ethics who becomes deeply disturbed to learn that his neighbor Max Mueller (Lemmon) has been accused of being the notorious death camp commandant Karl ""the Beast of Berkau"" Luger, a man responsible for thousands of deaths. After wrestling a bit with his conscience, Lambert poisons the apples on Muellers trees, causing his neighbors swift demise. When the press labels the death a suicide, the outraged Lambert sends an anonymous letter to the press stating that he deliberately offed Mueller. Not long afterward, Lambert learns that Mueller may have been innocent after all. Filled with remorse, Mueller dumps his girlfriend to marry Muellers plain-jane daughter Inga (Tomlin) as a form of penance.

With this powerful, dramatic portrait, which filmmaker/screenwriter Mary Harron tries to shed light on the troubled Solanas motivations. Claiming that her portrayal of the events is 95% accurate, Harron has carefully re-created the events, locations and the strange coterie surrounding the influential artist. Officially its been recorded that Solanas acted in retaliation after Warhol banned her from his inner sanctum, The Factory, for making trouble. But the real reasons for her bottomless rage soon manifest. Abused as a child, Solanas became a prostitute in high school and also discovered her homosexuality. By college, Solanas was a notorious man-hater. In 1966, Solanas wrote her famed SCUM Manifesto a ""revolutionary"" tract against all men. It was her dream that her Society for Cutting Up Men would become a major movement, but in the end, Solanas was the only member. She then wrote a play called Up Your Ass. Convinced that only the great Warhol could do the subversive work justice, she finagled a way into the Factory with her transvestite friend Candy Darling -- who would later become one of Warhols superstars -- and presented the work to the artist. None of the party-goers were particularly interested in the work, but eventually Warhol did allow Solanas to appear in one film I, a Man. Though a regular at Factory gatherings, the aggressive, increasingly radical Solanas became too intense for Warhols drugged, hedonistic cadre and the artist exiled her from his loft.

Lucys mother has committed suicide since then, and the teenager also hopes to discover the identity of her father, whom her mother hinted was a resident of the villa. Once she arrives, Lucy meets a variety of eccentric visitors, including a dying gay playwright (Jeremy Irons), a sculptor (Donal McCann), an entertainment lawyer (D.W. Moffet), and several others. Lucy has decided to lose her virginity and becomes an object of intense interest to the men of the household, but the suitor she finally selects is not the initial object of her affection.

Since Archer saw her first, he takes the case -- and later that evening he is shot to death, as is the mysterious Thursby.

Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchells best-selling novel, into nearly four hours worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7-million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett OHara (Vivien Leigh) hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) plans to marry ""mealy mouthed"" Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Despite warnings from her father (Thomas Mitchell) and her faithful servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks. Alone with Ashley, she goes into a fit of histrionics, all of which is witnessed by roguish Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), the black sheep of a wealthy Charleston family, who is instantly fascinated by the feisty, thoroughly self-centered Scarlett: ""Were bad lots, both of us."" The movies famous action continues from the burning of Atlanta (actually the destruction of a huge wall left over from King Kong) through the now-classic closing line, ""Frankly, my dear, I dont give a damn."" Holding its own against stiff competition (many consider 1939 to be the greatest year of the classical Hollywood studios), Gone With the Wind won ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel, the first African-American to win an Oscar).

Based on Arthur C. Clarkes story The Sentinel, Kubrick and Clarkes screenplay is structured in four movements. At the ""Dawn of Man,"" a group of hominids encounters a mysterious black monolith alien to their surroundings. To the strains of Strausss 1896 Also sprach Zarathustra, a hominid invents the first weapon, using a bone to kill prey. As the hominid tosses the bone in the air, Kubrick cuts to a 21st century spacecraft hovering over the Earth, skipping ahead millions of years in technological development. U.S. scientist Dr. Heywood Floyd (William Sylvester) travels to the moon to check out the discovery of a strange object on the moons surface: a black monolith. As the suns rays strike the stone, however, it emits a piercing, deafening sound that fills the investigators headphones and stops them in their path. Cutting ahead 18 months, impassive astronauts David Bowman (Keir Dullea) and Frank Poole (Gary Lockwood) head toward Jupiter on the spaceship Discovery, their only company three hibernating astronauts and the vocal, man-made HAL 9000 computer running the entire ship. When the all-too-human HAL malfunctions, however, he tries to murder the astronauts to cover his error, forcing Bowman to defend himself the only way he can. Free of HAL, and finally informed of the voyages purpose by a recording from Floyd, Bowman journeys to ""Jupiter and Beyond the Infinite,"" through the psychedelic slit-scan star-gate to an 18th century room, and the completion of the monoliths evolutionary mission.With assistance from special-effects expert Douglas Trumbull, Kubrick spent over two years meticulously creating the most ""realistic"" depictions of outer space ever seen, greatly advancing cinematic technology for a story expressing grave doubts about technology itself. Despite some initial critical reservations that it was too long and too dull, 2001 became one of the most popular films of 1968, underlining the generation gap between young moviegoers who wanted to see something new and challenging and oldsters who ""didnt get it."" Provocatively billed as ""the ultimate trip,"" 2001 quickly caught on with a counterculture youth audience open to a contemplative (i.e. chemically enhanced) viewing experience of a film suggesting that the way to enlightenment was to free ones mind of the U.S. military-industrial-technological complex. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi",G,"Classics, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Stanley Kubrick,Warner Bros.

Joel McCrea stars as an American journalist sent by his newspaper to cover the volatile war scene in Europe in the years 1938 to 1940. He has barely arrived in Holland before he witnesses the assassination of Dutch diplomat Albert Basserman: at least, thats what he thinks he sees.

Escaping the law, Grant heads to the Cote DAzur, where he is greeted with hostility by his old partners in crime. All of them had been pardoned due to their courageous activities in the wartime Resistance, and all are in danger of arrest thanks to this new crime wave. But Grant pleads innocence, and vows to find out whos been copying his distinctive style. With the reluctant aid of detective John Williams, Grant launches his investigation by keeping tabs on the wealthiest vacationers on the Riviera. One such person is heavily bejeweled Jessie Royce Landis, who is as brash and outspoken as her daughter Grace Kelly is quiet and demure. But ""still waters run deep,"" as they say, and soon Kelly is amorously pursuing the far-from-resistant Grant. Part of Kellys attraction to Grant is the possibility that he is the thief; the prospect of danger really turns this gal on. Being Cary Grant, of course, he cant possibly be guilty, which is proven in due time. But by films end, its obvious that Kelly has fallen hard for Grant, crook or no crook. Occasionally written off as a lesser Alfred Hitchcock film (did we really need that third-act fashion show?), To Catch a Thief is actually as enjoyable and engaging now as it was 40 years ago. Though the Riviera location photography is pleasing, our favorite scene takes place in a Paramount Studios mockup of a luxury hotel suite, where Grant and Kelly make love while a fireworks display orgasmically erupts outside their window.

Giant opens circa 1922 in Maryland, where Texas rancher Jordan ""Bick"" Benedict (Rock Hudson) has arrived to buy a stallion called War Winds from its owner, Dr. Horace Lynnton (Paul Fix). But much as Bick loves and knows horses, he finds himself even more transfixed by the doctors daughter, Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), and after some awkward moments, she has to admit that shes equally drawn to the shy, laconic Texan. They get married and Leslie spends her honeymoon traveling with Jordan to his ranch, Reata, which covers nearly a million acres of Texas. Once there, however, she finds that she has to push her way into her rightful role as mistress of the house, past Bicks sister, Luz (Mercedes McCambridge), who cant accept her brothers marriage or the changes it means in the home they share. Also working around Reata is the laconic ranch hand Jett Rink (James Dean) -- from a family as rooted in Texas as the Benedicts but not nearly as lucky (or ""foxy""), Jett is dirt-poor and barely educated at all, and he fairly oozes resentment at Bick for his arrogance, although Luz likes him and for that reason alone Bick is obliged to keep him on. One thing Jett does have in common with his employer is that he is in awe of Leslies beauty; another is his nearly total contempt for the Mexican-Americans who work for them -- Jett and Bick may have contempt for each other, but either one is just as likely to dismiss the Mexican-Americans around them as a bunch of shiftless ""wetbacks."" Luz feels so threatened with a loss of power and control that she decides to assert herself with War Winds, yet another ""prize"" that Bick brought back from Maryland that resists her authority -- then decides to ride the stallion despite being warned that no one but Leslie is wholly safe on him, and spurs him brutally in an effort to break him, which ends up destroying them both in the battle of wills she starts. After Luzs death, Jett learns that she left him a tiny piece of land for his own, on Reata, which he refuses to sell back to Bick, preferring to keep it for his own and maybe prospect for oil on it. Meanwhile, Leslie and Bick have their own problems -- Leslie cant abide the wretched conditions in which the Mexican families who work on Reata are allowed to live, taking a special interest in Mr. and Mrs. Obregon and their baby, Angel; but Bick doesnt want his wife, or any member of his family, concerning themselves with ""those people."" Leslies humanity and her independence push their marriage to the limit, but Bick comes to accept this in his wife, and in four years of marriage they have three handsome children, a boy and two girls, and a loving if occasionally awkward home life. Meanwhile, Jett strikes oil on his land -- which hes named Little Reata -- and in a couple of years hes on his way to becoming the richest man in Texas, getting drilling contracts on all of the land in the area (except Reata) and making more money than the Benedicts ever saw from raising cattle. Bick is almost oblivious to the way Jett grows in power and influence across the years and the state, mostly because hes got his own family to worry about, including a son, Jordan III (Dennis Hopper), who doesnt want to take over the ranch from him, but wants instead to be a doctor; an older daughter, Judy (Fran Bennett), who wants to study animal husbandry and marry a local rancher (Earl Holliman) and start a tiny spread of her own; and a younger daughter, Luz (Carroll Baker), whos just a bit man-crazy and star-struck by the movies.The American entry into the Second World War and the resulting need for oil forces Bick to go into business with Jett and allow him to drill on Reata, and suddenly the Benedicts are wealthy enough to be part of Jett Rinks circle, which includes the governor of the state and at least one United States senator at his beck and call -- and Luz develops a serious crush on Jett, who likes his women young and is especially attracted to her, as Bicks and Leslies daughter. Young Jordan marries Juana, a Mexican-American nursing student (Elsa Cardenas), and his father accepts it begrudgingly, with help from Leslie. The war kills Angel Obregon (Sal Mineo), a death that even affects Bick, but the Benedict family gets through it wealthier than ever and grows some more with the birth of Jordan IV to Jordie and Juana. When the family attends a gala opening of Jett Rink Airport, which concludes with a dinner honoring Jetts success, however, young Jordans wife is humiliated by Jetts racist edicts, and he is beaten up by Jetts men after punching the oil baron. Seeing this, Bick challenges his old rival to the fight thats been brewing for a quarter of a century and wins by default, Jett being too drunk to defend himself or to hit; hes also too drunk to make the grand speech that was to climax the celebration, and he ends up alone in the ballroom. The Benedicts have it out with each other, young Jordan accusing his father of being as much a racist as Jett, and Leslie caught in the middle between her husband and her son. It looks like the Benedicts may lose each other, until an encounter with a racist diner owner forces Bick to stand up and get knocked down (more than once) defending his daughter-in-law and his grandson. Seen today, Giant seems the least dated of any of James Deans three starring films, in part because it addresses issues that remain relevant more than 50 years later, and also because it has the best all-around acting and the best script of any of the three. Taken in broader terms, its even better, with two of the best performances that Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson ever gave, and perhaps the second best of Hudsons whole career (after Seconds) -- the only unfortunate element at modern theatrical screenings is the tendency of younger viewers, who only know him in terms of the revelations late in his life of his being gay, to laugh and snicker at elements of Hudsons characterization; but his work is so good that the titters usually fade after the first 30 minutes or so. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi",G,"Classics, Drama, Western, Romance",George Stevens,Warner Bros.

As the film opens, its Christmas Eve, 1946, and George, who has long considered himself a failure, faces financial ruin and arrest and is seriously contemplating suicide. High above Bedford Falls, two celestial voices discuss Baileys dilemma and decide to send down eternally bumbling angel Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers), who after 200 years has yet to earn his wings, to help George out. But first, Clarence is given a crash course on Georges life, and the multitude of selfless acts he has performed: rescuing his younger brother from drowning, losing the hearing in his left ear in the process; enduring a beating rather than allow a grieving druggist (H.B. Warner) to deliver poison by mistake to an ailing child; foregoing college and a long-planned trip to Europe to keep the Bailey Building and Loan from letting its Depression-era customers down; and, most important, preventing town despot Potter (Lionel Barrymore) from taking over Bedford Mills and reducing its inhabitants to penury. Along the way, George has married his childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed), who has stuck by him through thick and thin. But even the love of Mary and his children are insufficient when George, faced with an $8000 shortage in his books, becomes a likely candidate for prison thanks to the vengeful Potter. Bitterly, George declares that he wishes that he had never been born, and Clarence, hoping to teach George a lesson, shows him how different life would have been had he in fact never been born. After a nightmarish odyssey through a George Bailey-less Bedford Falls (now a glorified slum called Potterville), wherein none of his friends or family recognize him, George is made to realize how many lives he has touched, and helped, through his existence; and, just as Clarence had planned, George awakens to the fact that, despite all its deprivations, he has truly had a wonderful life.

Taylor orders Hopper to appoint an interim senator to fill out Foleys term; Taylor has proposed a pork barrel bill to finance an unneeded dam at Willet Creek, so he warns Hopper he wants a senator who ""cant ask any questions or talk out of turn."" After having a number of his appointees rejected, at the suggestion of his children Hopper nominates local hero Jefferson Smith (James Stewart), leader of the states Boy Rangers group. Smith is an innocent, wide-eyed idealist who quotes Jefferson and Lincoln and idolizes Paine, who had known his crusading editor father. In Washington, after a humiliating introduction to the press corps, Smith threatens to resign, but Paine encourages him to stay and work on a bill for a national boys camp. With the help of his cynical secretary Clarissa Sanders (Jean Arthur), Smith prepares to introduce his boys camp bill to the Senate. But when he proposes to build the camp on the Willets Creek site, Taylor and Paine force him to drop the measure. Smith discovers Taylor and Paine want the Willets Creek site for graft and he attempts to expose them, but Paine deflects Smiths charges by accusing Smith of stealing money from the boy rangers. Defeated, Smith is ready to depart Washington, but Saunders, whose patriotic zeal has been renewed by Smith, exhorts him to stay and fight. Smith returns to the Senate chamber and, while Taylor musters the media forces in his state to destroy him, Smith engages in a climactic filibuster to speak his piece: ""Ive got a few things I want to say to this body. I tried to say them once before and I got stopped colder than a mackerel. Well, Id like to get them said this time, sir. And as a matter of fact, Im not gonna leave this body until I do get them said."" ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi",NR,"Classics, Comedy, Drama",Frank Capra,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,130 minutes,"James Stewart, Jean Arthur, Astrid Allwyn"

David Huxley (Grant) is the stuffy paleontologist who needs to finish an exhibit on dinosaurs and thus land a $1 million grant for his museum. At a golf outing with his potential benefactors, Huxley is spotted by Susan Vance (Hepburn) who decides that she must have the reserved scientist at all costs. She uses her pet leopard, Baby, to trick him into driving to her Connecticut home, where a dog wanders into Huxleys room and steals the vital last bone that he needs to complete his project. The real trouble begins when another leopard escapes from the local zoo and Baby is mistaken for it, leading Huxley and Susan into a series of harebrained and increasingly more insane schemes to save the cat from the authorities. Inevitably, the two end up in the local jail, where things get even more out of hand: Susan pretends to be the gun moll to Davids diabolical, supposedly wanted criminal. Naturally, the mismatched pair falls in love through all the lunacy.

She recalls her near-impulsive marriage to newspaper reporter Roger Adams (Cary Grant), which begins on a deliriously happy note but turns out to be fraught with tragedy. While honeymooning in Japan, Julie and Roger are trapped in the 1923 earthquake, which results in her miscarriage and subsequent incapability to bear children. Upon their return to America, Roger becomes editor of a small-town newspaper, just scraping by financially. Despite their depleted resources, Julie and Roger want desperately to adopt a child. It seems hopeless until kindly adoption agency head Miss Oliver (Beulah Bondi) helps smooth their path. Alas, their happiness is once more short-lived: their new daughter, Trina (Eva Lee Kuney), succumbs to a sudden illness at the age of six. Reduced to hopelessness, Julie and Roger decide to dissolve their marriage, but Miss Oliver once more comes to the rescue. Sentimental in the extreme, Penny Serenade is also enormously effective, balancing moments of heartbreaking pathos with uproarious laughter. Only director George Stevens could have handled a scene with a copiously weeping Cary Grant without inducing discomfort or embarrassment in the audience.

In Lady of Burlesque -- which, at times, has a Hawksian edge to the dialogue -- she portrays Dixie Daisy, a striptease artist at a Broadway theater in New York at the end of the 1930s. In the course of fending off the unwanted advances of brash comic Biff Brannigan (Michael OShea), with whom she is teamed in several numbers, and staying clear of the dressing room feuds of her fellow dancers -- including a very nasty dispute between Dolly Baxter (Gloria Dickson) and Lolita La Verne (Victoria Faust) -- she finds herself up to her neck in trouble when one of the women is found strangled with her own G-string. The police dont know what to make of it, especially as the victim was already dying of a fatal dose of poison, which means that there are two murderers somewhere in the theater; and when a second woman turns up strangled inside a prop that Dixie was supposed to be hiding in onstage, she looks like a good suspect. Between the backstage comedy-drama, and the songs, dances, and on-stage comic routines, with the police breathing down both their necks at different times, Dixie and Biff manage to solve the mystery and find each other in this briskly paced, funny, yet amazingly gritty comedy-thriller. Lady of Burlesque was allowed to fall out of copyright in 1971, and since then it was seen in substandard editions until the May 2001 DVD release from Image Entertainment.",NR,"Classics, Comedy, Horror, Musical & Performing Arts, Mystery & Suspense",William Wellman,United Artists,91 minutes,"Barbara Stanwyck, Michael O'Shea, Iris Adrian"

Adapted from a novel by C.S. Forester, The African Queen stars Humphrey Bogart in his Oscar-winning portrayal of Charlie Allnut, the slovenly, gin-swilling captain of a tramp steamer called the African Queen, which ships supplies to small East African villages during World War I. Katharine Hepburn plays Rose Sayer, the maiden-lady sister of a prim British missionary, Rev. Samuel Sayer (Robert Morley). When Germans invade and Samuel dies, Allnut offers to take Rose back to civilization. She cant tolerate his drinking or bad manners; he isnt crazy about her imperious, judgmental attitude. However it does not take long before their passionate dislike turns to love. Together the disparate duo work to ensure their survival on the treacherous waters and devise an ingenious way to destroy a German gunboat. The African Queen may well be the perfect adventure film, its roller-coaster storyline complemented by the chemistry between its stars. The profound difficulties inherent in filming on location in Africa have been superbly documented by several books, including one written by Katharine Hepburn.

Fess Parker plays Davy Crockett, Tennessee-born frontiersman, while Buddy Ebsen (Disneys original choice for Crockett) co-stars as Davys sidekick George Russell. The film is divided into three long episodes, each separated by a title card. Part one shows Crockett the Indian fighter (politically correct? Of course not!); part two finds Davy winning a seat in the Nashville legislature, where his heroism is rather cynically exploited by presidential candidate Andrew Jackson (Basil Ruysdael); and part three concludes at the Alamo, with a discreet cutaway just before Davy meets his doom at the hands of Mexican general Santa Anna. Also appearing in this jerry-built film are Hans Conried as Thimblerig and Helene Stanley as Davys wife Polly. And who could forget ""The Ballad of Davy Crockett""--not to mention those neato coonskin caps?

One day, a buddy of Guys tells him a local rock band, The One-Ders (its pronounced ""wonders""), are in need of a drummer -- they have Battle of the Bands coming up and their usual timekeeper has broken his arm. Guy agrees to sit in, but when its time to play their best original, a love ballad called ""That Thing You Do,"" Guy lays in a sharp, driving beat that turns the tune into an uptempo pop-rocker. Lead singer Jimmy (Johnathon Schaech) isnt happy at first, but guitarist Lenny (Steve Zahn) and the nameless Bass Player (Ethan Embry) think the song sounds better that way -- and they notice the girls like it just fine. Soon people are actually requesting the song at their shows, and the One-Ders scrape together some money to press a single of ""That Thing You Do"" to sell between sets.

Francoise was Picassos lover from 1944 to 1954, and they had two children together, Claude and Paloma.

Hopkins powerfully portrays Picasso as an artistic genius with an appalling habit of using and abusing women. He not only cheats on his wife but two-times his mistresses. Francoise has survived an abusive relationship with her father (Bob Peck), and she is 40 years younger than Picasso when they become lovers. The film was supposed to be based on Gilots book Life with Picasso, but the filmmakers were unable to get the rights to it, so they settled for basing the film on Arianna Huffingtons Picasso: Creator and Destroyer.

Reynolds is assigned a 16-year-old convicted murderer, Brandon Monroe (Jon Seda), as his new patient. Brandon is a half-Cherokee gang member who killed his own stepfather, has terminal cancer, resents his privileged doctors, and has beaten up several pediatricians whove tried to care for him. Brandon gets a gun while going to the bathroom at the hospital and kidnaps Reynolds, stealing a car. While constantly threatening his doctors life, Brandon takes him on a trip to an Arizona Indian reservation with the aim of immersing himself in a magic lake which native tradition says has healing powers. Along the way, the pair meet up with motorcycle gang members, rattlesnakes, and several New Age philosophers. Eventually, the materialistic doctor and the young tough gain a grudging respect for each others values, and Reynolds even steals money to buy Brandon medicine.","R (adult situations/language, violence)","Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Michael Cimino,Warner Home Video,122 minutes,"Woody Harrelson, John Seda, Jon Seda"

It also caused major controversy by redefining violence in cinema and casting its criminal protagonists as sympathetic anti-heroes. Based loosely on the true exploits of Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker during the 30s, the film begins as Clyde (Beatty) tries to steal the car of Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway)s mother. Bonnie is excited by Clydes outlaw demeanor, and he further stimulates her by robbing a store in her presence. Clyde steals a car, with Bonnie in tow, and their legendary crime spree begins. The two move from town to town, pulling off small heists, until they join up with Clydes brother Buck (Gene Hackman), his shrill wife Blanche (Estelle Parsons), and a slow-witted gas station attendant named C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard). The new gang robs a bank and Clyde is soon painted in the press as a Depression-era Robin Hood when he allows one bank customer to hold onto his money. Soon the police are on the gangs trail and they are constantly on the run, even kidnapping a Texas Ranger (Denver Pyle) and setting him adrift on a raft, handcuffed, after he spits in Bonnies face when she kisses him. That same ranger leads a later raid on the gang that leaves Buck dying, Blanche captured, and both Clyde and Bonnie injured. The ever-loyal C.W. takes them to his fathers house. C.W.s father disaproves his sons affiliation with gangsters and enters a plea bargain with the Texas Rangers. A trap is set that ends in one of the bloodiest death scenes in cinematic history. The film made stars out of Beatty and Dunaway, and it also featured the screen debut of Gene Wilder as a mortician briefly captured by the gang. Its portrayal of Bonnie and Clyde as rebels who empathized with the poor working folks of the 1930s struck a chord with the counterculture of the 1960s and helped generate a new, young audience for American movies that carried over into Hollywoods renewal of the 1970s. Its combination of sex and violence with dynamic stars, social relevance, a traditional Hollywood genre, and an appeal to hip young audiences set the pace for many American movies to come. ~ Don Kaye, Rovi",R (for violence),"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama",Arthur Penn,Warner Brothers/Seven Arts,111 minutes,"Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Michael J.

282,1071,Rebel Without a Cause,"Rebel Without a Cause is a searing melodrama featuring keen insight into '50s juvenile attitude and James Dean's cool, iconic performance.",96%,49,88%,58514,"This landmark juvenile-delinquent drama scrupulously follows the classic theatrical disciplines, telling all within a 24-hour period. Teenager Jimmy Stark (James Dean) cant help but get into trouble, a problem that has forced his appearance-conscious parents (Jim Backus and Ann Doran) to move from one town to another. The films tormented central characters are all introduced during a single night-court session, presided over by well-meaning social worker Ray (Edward Platt). Jimmy, arrested on a drunk-and-disorderly charge, screams ""Youre tearing me apart!"" as his blind-sided parents bicker with one another over how best to handle the situation. Judy (Natalie Wood) is basically a good kid but behaves wildly out of frustration over her inability to communicate with her deliberately distant father (William Hopper). (The incestuous subtext of this relationship is discreetly handled, but the audience knows whats going on in the minds of Judy and her dad at all times.) And Plato (Sal Mineo), who is so sensitive that he threatens to break apart like porcelain, has taken to killing puppies as a desperate bid for attention from his wealthy, always absent parents. The next morning, Jimmy tries to start clean at a new high school, only to run afoul of local gang leader Buzz (Corey Allen), who happens to be Judys boyfriend. Anxious to fit in, Jimmy agrees to settle his differences with a nocturnal ""Chickie Run"": he and Buzz are to hop into separate stolen cars, then race toward the edge of a cliff; whoever jumps out of the car first is the ""chickie."" When asked if hes done this sort of thing before, Jimmy lies, ""Thats all I ever do."" This wins him the undying devotion of fellow misfit Plato. At the appointed hour, the Chickie Run takes place, inaugurated by a wave of the arms from Judy. The cars roar toward the cliff; Jimmy is able to jump clear, but Buzz, trapped in the drivers set when his coat gets caught on the door handle, plummets to his death. In the convoluted logic of Buzz gang, Jimmy is held responsible for the boys death. For the rest of the evening, he is mercilessly tormented by Buzz pals, even at his own doorstep. After unsuccessfully trying to sort things out with his weak-willed father, Jimmy runs off into the night. He links up with fellow ""lost souls"" Judy and Plato, hiding out in an abandoned palatial home and enacting the roles of father, mother, and son. For the first time, these three have found kindred spirits -- but the adults and kids who have made their lives miserable havent given up yet, leading to tragedy. Out of the bleakness of the finale comes a ray of hope that, at last, Jimmy will be truly understood. Rebel Without a Cause began as a case history, written in 1944 by Dr. Robert Lindner. Originally intended as a vehicle for Marlon Brando, the property was shelved until Brandos The Wild One (1953) opened floodgates for films about crazy mixed-up teens. Director Nicholas Ray, then working on a similar project, was brought in to helm the film version. His star was James Dean, fresh from Warners East of Eden. Rays low budget dictated that the new film be lensed in black-and-white, but when East of Eden really took off at the box office, the existing footage was scrapped and reshot in color. This was great, so far as Ray was concerned, inasmuch as he had a predilection for symbolic color schemes. James Deans hot red jacket, for example, indicated rebellion, while his very blue blue jeans created a near luminescent effect (Ray had previously used the same vivid color combination on Joan Crawford in Johnny Guitar). As part of an overall bid for authenticity, real-life gang member Frank Mazzola was hired as technical advisor for the fight scenes. To extract as natural a performance as possible from Dean, Ray redesigned the Stark familys living room set to resemble Rays own home, where Dean did most of his rehearsing. Speaking of interior sets, the mansion where the three troubled teens hide out had previously been seen as the home of Norma Desmond in Sunset Boulevard. Of the reams of on-set trivia concerning Rebel, one of the more amusing tidbits involves Deans quickie in-joke impression of cartoon character Mr. Magoo -- whose voice was, of course, supplied by Jim Backus, who played Jimmys father. Viewing the rushes of this improvisation, a clueless Warner Bros. executive took Dean to task, saying in effect that if he must imitate an animated character, why not Warners own Bugs Bunny? Released right after James Deans untimely death, Rebel Without a Cause netted an enormous profit. The film almost seems like a eulogy when seen today, since so many of its cast members -- James Dean, Natalie Wood, Sal Mineo, Nick Adams -- died young. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",PG-13 (for some violence and sexual content.),"Classics, Drama",Nicholas Ray,Warner Bros.

On the fringes of sanity, Blanche is trying to forget her checkered past and start life anew. Attracted to Stanleys friend Mitch (Karl Malden), she glosses over the less savory incidents in her past, but she soon discovers that she cannot outrun that past, and the stage is set for her final, brutal confrontation with her brother-in-law.

In his last film, Henry Fonda plays Norman Thayer, a cranky 80-year-old retired professor, making his annual pilgrimage with his wife Katharine Hepburn (in her only teaming with Henry Fonda) to their New England summer cottage. Their solitude is interrupted when the couples daughter Chelsea (Jane Fonda) arrives with her fiance Bill (Dabney Coleman) and his son Doug McKeon in tow. It takes a while, but Jane Fonda and Coleman, about to go on a vacation of their own, persuade Henry Fonda and Hepburn to take care of McKeon. Henry Fonda and the kid dislike each other from Square One, and it looks as though this summer (which may very well be Henry Fondas last) will be a depressing experience. Gradually, Henry Fonda and McKeon grow to love one another; their bond is strengthened during a near-fatal accident while fishing. It is through the warm relationship between Henry Fonda and the boy that the old man and his daughter Jane Fonda are at last able to display affection towards each other--the first time theyve done so in years. Gorgeously photographed by Billy Williams, On Golden Pond is a wonderful valedictory for Henry Fonda, who died not long after the films completion; Katharine Hepburn has less to do, but few can do so much with so little.

Once in the desert, he befriends Sherif Ali Ben El Kharish (Omar Sharif, making one of the most spectacular entrances in movie history) and draws up plans to aid the Arabs in their rebellion against the Turks. No one is ever able to discern Lawrences motives in this matter: Prince Feisal (Alec Guinness) dismisses him as yet another ""desert-loving Englishman,"" and his British superiors assume that hes either arrogant or mad. Using a combination of diplomacy and bribery, Lawrence unites the rival Arab factions of Feisal and Auda Abu Tayi (Anthony Quinn). After successfully completing his mission, Lawrence becomes an unwitting pawn of the Allies, as represented by Gen. Allenby (Jack Hawkins) and Dryden (Claude Rains), who decide to keep using Lawrence to secure Arab cooperation against the Imperial Powers. While on a spying mission to Deraa, Lawrence is captured and tortured by a sadistic Turkish Bey (Jose Ferrer). In the heat of the next battle, a wild-eyed Lawrence screams ""No prisoners!"" and fights more ruthlessly than ever. Screenwriters Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson used T. E. Lawrences own self-published memoir The Seven Pillars of Wisdom as their principal source, although some of the characters are composites, and many of the ""historical"" incidents are of unconfirmed origin. Two years in the making (you can see OTooles weight fluctuate from scene to scene), the movie, lensed in Spain and Jordan, ended up costing a then-staggering $13 million and won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. The 1962 Royal Premiere in London was virtually the last time that David Leans directors cut was seen: 20 minutes were edited from the films general release, and 15 more from the 1971 reissue. This abbreviated version was all that was available for public exhibition until a massive 1989 restoration, at 216 minutes that returned several of Leans favorite scenes while removing others with which he had never been satisfied. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",PG (N/A),"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama",David Lean,Columbia Pictures,222 minutes,"Peter O'Toole, Alec Guinness, Omar Sharif"

Finch puts his career on the line when he agrees to represent Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), a black man accused of rape. The trial and the events surrounding it are seen through the eyes of Finchs six-year-old daughter Scout (Mary Badham). While Robinsons trial gives the film its momentum, there are plenty of anecdotal occurrences before and after the court date: Scouts ever-strengthening bond with older brother Jem (Philip Alford), her friendship with precocious young Dill Harris (a character based on Lees childhood chum Truman Capote and played by John Megna), her fathers no-nonsense reactions to such life-and-death crises as a rampaging mad dog, and especially Scouts reactions to, and relationship with, Boo Radley (Robert Duvall in his movie debut), the reclusive ""village idiot"" who turns out to be her salvation when she is attacked by a venomous bigot.

Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen), already on the edge, is assigned to find and deal with AWOL Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando), rumored to have set himself up in the Cambodian jungle as a local, lethal godhead. Along the way Willard encounters napalm and Wagner fan Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), draftees who prefer to surf and do drugs, a USO Playboy Bunny show turned into a riot by the raucous soldiers, and a jumpy photographer (Dennis Hopper) telling wild, reverent tales about Kurtz. By the time Willard sees the heads mounted on stakes near Kurtzs compound, he knows Kurtz has gone over the deep end, but it is uncertain whether Willard himself now agrees with Kurtzs insane dictum to ""Drop the Bomb. Exterminate them all."" Coppola himself was not certain either, and he tried several different endings between the films early rough-cut screenings for the press, the Palme dOr-winning ""work-in-progress"" shown at Cannes, and the final 35 mm U.S. release (also the ending on the video cassette). The chaotic production also experienced shut-downs when a typhoon destroyed the set and star Sheen suffered a heart attack; the budget ballooned and Coppola covered the overages himself. These production headaches, which Coppola characterized as being like the Vietnam War itself, have been superbly captured in the documentary, Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse. Despite the studios fears and mixed reviews of the films ending, Apocalypse Now became a substantial hit and was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Supporting Actor for Duvalls psychotic Kilgore, and Best Screenplay. It won Oscars for sound and for Vittorio Storaros cinematography. This hallucinatory, Wagnerian project has produced admirers and detractors of equal ardor; it resembles no other film ever made, and its nightmarish aura and polarized reception aptly reflect the tensions and confusions of the Vietnam era. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi","R (adult situations/language, violence)","Action & Adventure, Drama",Francis Ford Coppola,United Artists,153 minutes,"Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall"

From its first scene, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel (hardly a common moment in a major studio film in 1960), Psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint.

Amadeus is an expansion of a Viennese ""urban legend"" concerning the death of 18th century musical genius Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the vantage point of an insane asylum, aging royal composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) recalls the events of three decades earlier, when the young Mozart (Tom Hulce) first gained favor in the court of Austrian emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri was incensed that God would bless so vulgar and obnoxious a young snipe as Mozart with divine genius. Why was Salieri -- so disciplined, so devoted to his art, and so willing to toady to his superiors -- not touched by God? Unable to match Mozarts talent, Salieri uses his influence in court to sabotage the young upstarts career. Disguising himself as a mysterious benefactor, Salieri commissions the backbreaking Requiem, which eventually costs Mozart his health, wealth, and life. Among the films many pearls of dialogue, the best line goes to the emperor, who rejects a Mozart composition on the grounds that it has ""too many notes.""

Irreverent of such advice as characters in horror films always are, the two decide to find a short cut....David wakes up in the hospital with a nasty bite wound to his shoulder; the freshly deceased, and rapidly decomposing, Jack arrives soon after to deliver the grim news that, unless he commits suicide, David will become a werewolf when the moon is full. David dismisses the encounter as a hallucination, but all indicators point to lycanthrope; evenings of barking and bloodletting follow closely behind. While the story is thin and much of the tongue-in-cheek humor is overdone, there are plenty of genuine jolts thanks to makeup guru Rick Bakers eye-popping special effects. The werewolf, resembling a cross between a bear and a wolverine, appears frighteningly real, and, given the fantastic premise, the gore is most convincing (although surprisingly and refreshingly scant). The hospital dream sequences are creative, and the scenes in which the werewolf runs rampant through downtown London are particularly good. In all, An American Werewolf in London is an original, atmospheric film that manages both to scare and amuse. While dismissed by most American critics upon its release, the film managed to secure a place in the annals of American cinema when Baker won an Academy Award for his amazing effects and creature designs. ~ Jeremy Beday, Rovi","R (adult situations/language, nudity, violence)","Comedy, Horror, Science Fiction & Fantasy",John Landis,Universal Pictures,97 minutes,"David Naughton, Griffin Dunne, Jenny Agutter"

In a peaceful Arkansas suburb, three eight-year-old boys are found maimed and brutally slain -- one of them was castrated. The community understandably goes into an uproar until one, mentally slow teen, Jason, comes forward and claims that he and two others killed the boys as part of a Satanic ritual. All are arrested, but the other teens, Damien and Jason, swear that they are innocent. The filmmakers then present widely disparate opinions from community members concerning the youths guilt or innocence. The stepfather of one of the slain boys, vents his feelings by speaking to a pumpkin and then blowing it away with a gun. The whole trial is suspect and is based upon the testimony of Jesse who has an IQ of 74 and cannot keep his story straight. There is little evidence to conclusively prove or disprove their guilt. The filmmakers also intimate that others may have been involved, but those possibilities remain largely unexplored. The three boys all ended up convicted, but the niggling doubts remain.","NR (adult situations/language, violence)","Documentary, Special Interest","Joe Berlinger, Bruce Sinofsky",Docurama,150 minutes,"Bruce Sinofsky, Damien Wayne Echols, Jason Baldwin"

As the movie opens, months have elapsed since the events in Star Trek III; Admiral Kirk (William Shatner), McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Scott (James Doohan), Sulu (George Takei), Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), and Chekhov (Walter Koenig) are marooned in self-imposed exile on Vulcan, along with the resurrected and regenerated Spock (Leonard Nimoy, who also directed).

Taking off in their commandeered, jerry-rigged Klingon ship, they head to Earth, not knowing that a new crisis could destroy their home world -- a huge, immensely powerful alien probe has entered the galaxy and established a position near Earth, disabling every vehicle and installation in its path with its energy and communication output, and has ionized the entire atmosphere and started vaporizing the oceans, leaving the planet only hours to survive. Spock determines that the probe is sending out signals to another intelligent terrestrial life form, humpbacked whales, which no longer exist.

The screenplay, co-authored by Steve Meerson, Peter Krikes, Nicholas Meyer, and Harve Bennett (from a story by Nimoy and Bennett), is the cleverest and most sophisticated of all the Star Trek movie screenplays, recalling some of the elements of Meyers earlier time-travel movie Time After Time and also anticipating the feel and tone of the series Star Trek: The Next Generation (which would be on the air not quite a year later).

Characters like Vaughn, the charismatic group leader who stages recreations of celebrity car crashes, seem more like driven researchers than sexual renegades, which is undoubtedly part of the films point. This impression is reinforced by the pristine cinematography by Peter Suschitzsky, which proves particularly haunting during a crucial accident scene, and Howard Shores superb score.

Written and directed by Gregory Nava, this biopic concentrates on Selenas relationship with her family and her rise to fame, dealing only briefly with her tragic death. Abraham Quintanilla (Edward James Olmos) is a veteran musician who leads a family-based singing group, The Dinos. At a young age, he notices that his daughter Selena (played as a child by Becky Lee Meza) has a strong singing voice, and he works her into the act (her big number is a version of Over the Rainbow). However, as she grows older, Selena (played as an adult by Jennifer Lopez) wants to establish her own musical identity; while her heritage is Mexican-American, her primary language is English, and her favorite artists are American pop acts like Donna Summer. While Selena and Abraham sometimes argue about the musical direction of the group, he always respects and supports her talent, and her blend of Tejano roots music and danceable pop rhythms soon sparks a revolution in Latin music. Selena later earns the wrath of her father when she becomes romantically involved with Chris Perez (Jon Seda), a rebellious and long-haired guitarist hired to play with the group, but when they elope and Selena convinces Abraham that their love is sincere, Chris is welcomed into the family. After a long string of successes on the Latin charts and playing to a sellout crowd at the Houston Astrodome and a crowd of 100,000 at a stadium in Monterey, Mexico, Selena begins recording her first album in English, which is expected to make her a mainstream star on the level of Whitney Houston or Gloria Estefan.

Dudley Smith (James Cromwell) is the head of the LAPD and is loyal to his officers and eager to turn a blind eye to violence or corruption within his department, as long as its the ""bad guys"" who are getting hurt. Bud White (Russell Crowe) is a police detective whose violent and cynical nature is often at war with his basic sense of decency and justice. Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) is a beat cop-turned-detective whose strict by-the-book philosophy and willingness to blow the whistle on other officers is balanced by a shrewd and opportunistic understanding of the internal politics of the department. And Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) is a flashy ""Hollywood"" detective who serves as technical advisor for the TV series Badge of Honor. He is also in cahoots with Sid Hudgeons (Danny DeVito), publisher of the scandal sheet Hush Hush, who throws kickbacks to Vincennes in exchange for being brought along when showbiz figures get busted. White, Exley, and Vincennes find themselves drawn into a tangled and sticky web of violence and betrayal following a multiple murder at a coffee shop that is believed to be part of an effort by Mickey Cohen (Paul Guilfoyle) to consolidate his hold on organized crime in L.A. This lead appears to be connected to the discovery of a bizarre pornography and call-girl ring operated by Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), whose women are given plastic surgery so that they more closely resemble well-known movie stars. Whites role in the investigation is complicated when he falls for Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger), one of Patchetts prostitutes, who is the spitting image of Veronica Lake. L.A.

A creation of Atkinson and writers Richard Curtis and Robin Driscoll, Mr. Bean started out in a half-hour television series around 1990; since then his show has become one of the highest rated comedies on British television and has gained an international cult following. With a style reminiscent of the great silent comedians, Bean is an average, albeit eccentric, Joe with a knack for turning the most innocuous situations into full-blown disasters. Whereas the television shows are nearly silent, Mr. Bean has a lot more dialog in the film. The film begins at the dawn of a typical day with Bean shaving his whole face, including his tongue. After a quick cup of coffee, he heads off for his job as guard/caretaker at the Royal National Gallery where he is supposed to prevent visitors from touching the artwork. Instead, Bean spends most of his time sleeping. His supervisors try to fire him, but a board member (John Mills) intervenes and saves his job. To get rid of him, Beans bosses conspire to send him to a posh Los Angeles private art gallery where as an ""art scholar"" he will deliver a speech to commemorate the return of ""Whistlers Mother"" which was purchased by Army General Newton (Burt Reynolds) through a deal facilitated by the gallery owner George Grierson (Harris Yulin). Bean is to stay with the family of David Langley (Peter MacNicol), the gallery director. He isnt there long before he nearly destroys the place. His speech at the gallery is even more cataclysmic.

In the female lead, Joanne Whalley returned to films after a three-year absence, choosing to do so with director Amiel. Farrars Hitchcockian-style story focuses on naive Blockbuster Video clerk Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray) who travels from Des Moines, Iowa, to London to celebrate his birthday with his wealthy younger brother, James (Peter Gallagher). When he turns up on the same night that James has plans to attend a high-profile client dinner party (that he hopes will bring him millions from a German investment firm), James needs to keep Wallace away during the evening, so he gives Wallace a ticket to the participatory Theater of Life. The theater game requires Wallace to assume a character and interact with actors portraying people in dramatic situations. At the corner phone booth, the initial call should begin the evening of innocent fun. However, the phone instructions Wallace receives are actually intended for an assassin, part of a scheme to end the current UK regime and revive the Cold War. The real assassin gets the call from the Theater of Life. Blissfully unaware, Wallace walks without fear into a complex web of intrigue involving defense ministers, call girls, and Russian hitmen. For Wallace, all the worlds a stage, and hes amazed at the skill of the actors, including beautiful enigmatic Lori (Joanne Whalley) -- while Wallaces pursuers are mystified by their adversarys fearlessness in the face of threats, torture and bullets. Farrar got the idea for this comedy from a chance remark at a party: ""The inspiration came from a dinner party, when somebody told me about these strange live theater performances which were all the rage in England in the 80s. The idea was to telephone for instructions if you wanted to take part. My immediate reaction was, Wouldnt it be fabulous if somebody got the wrong number, and it all went hopelessly wrong?""

Running over three hours and made with the combined contributions of two major studios (20th Century-Fox, Paramount) at a cost of more than $200 million, Titanic ranked as the most expensive film in Hollywood history at the time of its release, and became the most successful. Writer-director James Cameron employed state-of-the-art digital special effects for this production, realized on a monumental scale and spanning eight decades. Inspired by the 1985 discovery of the Titanic in the North Atlantic, the contemporary storyline involves American treasure-seeker Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) retrieving artifacts from the submerged ship. Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman, nude except for a necklace. When 102-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) reveals shes the person in the portrait, she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of 84 years earlier. The scene then shifts to 1912 Southampton where passengers boarding the Titanic include penniless Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), returning to Philadelphia with her wealthy fiance Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). After the April 10th launch, Rose develops a passionate interest in Jack, and Cals reaction is vengeful. At midpoint in the film, the Titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. Even engulfed, Cal continues to pursue Jack and Rose as the massive liner begins its descent. Cameron launched the project after seeing Robert Ballards 1987 National Geographic documentary on the wreckage. Blueprints of the real Titanic were followed during construction at Foxs custom-built Rosarito, Mexico studio, where a hydraulics system moved an immense model in a 17-million-gallon water tank. During three weeks aboard the Russian ship Academik Keldysh, underwater sequences were filmed with a 35mm camera in a titanium case mounted on the Russian submersible Mir 1. When the submersible neared the wreck, a video camera inside a remote-operated vehicle was sent into the Titanics 400-foot bow, bringing back footage of staterooms, furniture and chandeliers.

With a scheme simply to get food, he sets out to deliver 15-year-old mail, proclaiming himself The Postman, and discovers that residents accept his lies about a restored United States government because they desperately need something to believe in. This hope leads to the thought that perhaps the United States of America could indeed be restored, so an unusually inspired young man, Ford (Laren Tate) is deputized with the ""Neither snow, nor rain..."" oath to become the countrys second Postman.

When spring comes, they emerge to discover that Ford has organized an entire squad of mail deliverers who regard The Postman as a mythical hero.

The director of over 30 feature films, he was born, or rather created, as a pseudonym in 1967 for the film Death of a Gunfighter (which was not released until 1969). He owes his creation to Hollywood directors (and sometimes actors and others involved in the creative process) who feel that a project has been wrongfully over-edited, or is just too embarrassingly bad to merit their names upon it. The Directors Guild carefully regulates the usage of the famous pseudonym. Some believe the name is an anagram of The Alias Men, while others contend that the name was chosen because of its uniqueness -- no one in the world could possibly be named Alan Smithee, right? Wrong. The premise of this filmed attempt, by screenwriter Joe Eszterhas, to rake Hollywood over the coals is that there really is a Smithee (Eric Idle) and he has just finished his latest epic actioner Trio, which stars Sylvester Stallone, Whoopi Goldberg and Jackie Chan (these three are the first of several star cameos occurring throughout). Unhappy that domineering, egomaniacal producer James Edmunds (Ryan ONeal) -- who only hired Smithee because he thinks the directors an easily-manipulated sap -- has ruined Trio by over-editing it, Smithee goes to the Directors Guild to see about having his name removed from the credits. This proves problematic, for how can ""Alan Smithee"" be used if that is the directors real name. In desperation, the filmmaker kidnaps the negative of the $22-million movie and ultimately burns it. This act lands Smithee a spot in the Keith Moon Psychiatric Institute in England. It is from there that Smithee tells his version of the tale to investigators assigned to ""autopsy"" the film. His account is what comprises the bulk of the plot. One of the films treats is to look for stars such as Billy Bob Thornton and Sandra Bernhard, and Hollywood honchos, notably Miramax big-wig Harvey Weinstein, in cameo roles. There are also numerous inside jokes for film buffs. Ironically, the films real-life director Arthur Hiller had his name removed from An Alan Smithee Film because he didnt like the way in which Eszterhas recut the film.

Squad), following the trajectory of a mismatched couple throughout the evening of a blind date in New York (but mostly filmed in Toronto). Extrovert Darlene ""Woo"" Bates (Jada Pinkett Smith of Scream 2) is one woman whos not afraid to take what she wants, and she has a notorious knack for turning men into mush. When Woos psychic friend Celestrial (Girlina) predicts that the man of her dreams is about to enter her life, Woo doesnt believe its true. Celestrial, however, is convinced that Woo is destined to meet a tall, debonair Virgo. Woos cousin Claudette (Paula Jai Parker of Friday) and Claudettes boyfriend Lenny (Dave Chapelle of Con Air) plan to spend the night together but find themselves entertaining Woo instead. Fearing that his night alone with Claudette will be ruined, Lenny begs his best friend Tim Jackson (Tommy Davidson of Booty Call) to take Woo out -- even though shy, straight-laced law clerk Tim is the polar opposite of the sassy and brassy Woo. At first, Woo expresses disinterest in the matchmaking mismatch. But when shes told that Tim is a Virgo, she decides its fate, jumps at the chance, and immediately heads for Tims apartment. Meanwhile, Tim, who cant believe his luck, goes next door to his neighbor Darryl (LL Cool J of B.A.P.S.) for tips on romancing women. Darryl, who knows all the smooth moves, supplies Tim with incense, edible body oils, and a tape of sexy songs. When Woo arrives, Tim is completely smitten. Woo, however, discovers that Tim is anything but the sexy, spontaneous stud of her dreams. Finding Tims pseudo-cool act totally transparent, she humiliates and teases him. They are just about to exit Tims apartment when Tim gets a visit from three of his pals -- Frankie (Duane Martin of Getting Personal), Hop (Darrel M. Heath of B.A.P.S.), and Romaine (Michael Ralph of Do the Right Thing). The chauvinistic attitude of these guys irritates Woo, so she retaliates and freaks out the trio with wild, seemingly psycho behavior. Finally, the date gets underway. Woo and Tim arrive at a stuffy Italian restaurant, but Woos behavior gets them thrown out. They go to a dance club, where Tim becomes the victim, punched out by Woos ex-boyfriend. Woo likes a good laugh, and when Tim discovers the theft of his flashy new car, she finds this hilarious. ""Maybe we could be having a good time, if you could control your psychotic mood swings,"" says Tim. And so it goes, straight on till morning.

Despondent California senator Jay Bulworth (Beatty), up for re-election, is disillusioned by the usual campaign banalities; his marriage to Constance (Christine Baranski) seems equally hollow. In the midst of a nervous breakdown, Bulworth goes without sleep or food for three days and takes out a ten-million-dollar insurance policy on himself while arranging his own assassination. Drinking during a return to Los Angeles, Bulworth is scheduled to speak at an African-American church in South Central L.A. Once there, he tosses aside his prepared speech, startling both the audience and his campaign manager, Murphy (Oliver Platt), by improvising truthful remarks instead of the familiar rhetoric. These loose-cannon salvos gain the attention of an attractive young woman, Nina (Halle Berry). Bulworth finds an exhilaration with this new freestyle approach, and after shocking a gathering in Beverly Hills with further fulminations, Bulworth invites Nina and her girlfriends into his limo. During a spaced-out sojourn at one of South Centrals more frenzied after-hours clubs, Bulworth gains respect for hip-hop culture.Still reeling from insights gained by this nightlife, he arrives the next day for a fundraising function at the Beverly Wilshire, startling everyone with a diatribe delivered in the intonations of a rap artist. His interest in Nina and his new optimistic outlook on life give Bulworth a sense of elation and a will to live. He phones to call off the hit, but the gears have been set in motion. After an assumed hitman turns up during a church appearance, Bulworth flees, and Nina offers him a safe-house hideout at the home of her family, veterans of the civil rights movement. Here Bulworth goes through the final steps in his transformation -- making a Kennedy-styled connection with the disenfranchised as he tunes in to forgotten memories of the 60s. Outfitted in homeboy clothing, the born-again Bulworth heads for a TV station to unleash even more caustic comments on the American political scene. ~ Bhob Stewart, Rovi",R (For pervasive strong language and some drug content),"Comedy, Drama, Romance",Warren Beatty,20th Century Fox,107 minutes,"Warren Beatty, Halle Berry, Don Cheadle"

Employing professional eavesdropping equipment, Pat gathers a dossier on Marys life and future plans, information that forms the basis for more lies when Pat begins dating her. Sure enough, Mary falls for Pat, although her friend Tucker (Lee Evans) is very suspicious of Pats claim to be a Harvard-educated architect. Meanwhile, Ted learns the truth but continues to encounter offbeat obstacles as he accelerates to Miami in hopes of finding happiness with his true love.

Fortunately for the rest of humanity a courageous airline pilot is able to team up with a detective and stop them from enacting the dreaded ""Plan 9."" Hailed, with good reason, as one of the worst movies ever to disgrace the screen, Ed Woods Plan 9 from Outer Space, has become a camp classic with its dreadful production values (paper plate space ships and obviously fake cemetery grass are highlights), and cavalier attitudes to minor things such as editing and continuity. Though Wood was seriously trying to frighten his audience, the film is so bad that it cannot help but promote laughter. It does contain the last footage of Bela Lugosi, who died well before Wood made the film.

Too much time is afforded the wheezy old plotline about two World War I aviators (Buddy Rogers, Richard Arlen) in love with the same woman (Jobyna Ralston), while the comedy relief of El Brendel is decidedly not to everyones taste. But during the aerial ""dogfight"" sequences, the film is something else again: a grand-scale spectacular, the likes of which has never been duplicated, not even by more expensive efforts like Hells Angels (1930) and The Blue Max (1965). Twenty-eight-year-old director William Wellman, himself a wartime aviator, was fortunate enough to have the full cooperation of the US War department at his disposal (even though his legendary temper nearly lost him that cooperation on more than one occasion!) Brilliantly handled though the aerial scenes may be, they are matched by the Earthbound combat sequences, including the now-famous shot of a long trench caving in on hundreds of unfortunate doughboys. The storyline is as follows: Jack Powell (Rogers) and David Armstrong (${Powell}) hate each other during basic training, grow to like each other, and fall out again while competing for the affections of Sylvia Lewis (Ralston). Mary Preston (Clara Bow) sacrifices her own nursing career to save a drunken Powell from disgrace, Powell goes on a rampage when he believes his pal Armstrong has been killed, inadvertently shoots down Armstrong while decimating the German air corps, and is finally reunited with the nurse. Wrapped up in nurses garb throughout most of the film, the ebullient Clara Bow is permitted a sequence in which, disguised as a Parisian floozie while trying to rescue a revelling Rogers, she displays a great deal of epidermis. One of the films chief claims to fame is its ""introduction"" of Gary Cooper (whod actually been in films since the early 1920s), in a brief but crucial role as veteran flyer with a cheerily fatalistic attitude. When originally released, Wings included a sequence lensed in the wide-screen ""Magnascope"" process; even when seen ""flat"", however, the film contains some of the best flying sequences ever captured on celluloid. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",PG-13,"Action & Adventure, Classics",William Wellman,Unknown,144 minutes,"Clara Bow, Charles 'Buddy' Rogers, Richard Arlen"

Clark Gable stars as Fletcher Christian, first mate of the infamous HMS Bounty, skippered by Captain William Bligh (Charles Laughton), the cruelest taskmaster on the Seven Seas. Blighs villainy knows no bounds: he is even willing to flog a dead man if it will strengthen his hold over the crew. Christian despises Bligh and is sailing on the Bounty under protest. During the journey back to England, Blighs cruelties become more than Christian can bear; and after the captain indirectly causes the death of the ships doctor, the crew stages a mutiny, with Christian in charge. Bligh and a handful of officers loyal to him are set adrift in an open boat. Through sheer force of will, he guides the tiny vessel on a 49-day, 4000-mile journey to the Dutch East Indies without losing a man. Historians differ on whether Captain Bligh was truly such a monster or Christian such a paragon of virtue (some believe that the mutiny was largely inspired by Christians lust for the Tahitian girls). The movie struck gold at the box office, and, in addition to the Best Picture Oscar, Gable, Laughton, and Franchot Tone as one of the Bountys crew were all nominated for Best Actor (they all lost to Victor McLaglan in The Informer).

Kaufmans whimsical Pulitzer Prize-winning Broadway play +You Cant Take It With You was transformed into a paean to populism by director Frank Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin. This is the story of the zany Sycamore household, presided over by Grandpa Vanderhof (Lionel Barrymore), a former businessman who has turned his back on commerce to enjoy life. At the Sycamores, everyone does just what he or she pleases. Penny Sycamore (Spring Byington), Grandpas daughter, has become a novelist because someone delivered a typewriter to her home by mistake. Pennys husband makes firecrackers in his basement with the help of Mr. DePinna (Halliwell Hobbes), an iceman who showed up at the Sycamore doorstep one day and never left. Their daughter, Essie (Ann Miller), imagines that shes a prima ballerina, even though her dour teacher, Boris (Mischa Auer), assesses her work with, ""Confidentially, it steenks!"" Essies husband, Ed (Dub Taylor), whod rather play a xylophone than work, spends his free time selling Essies candy, wrapping each package in paper from a used printing press that dispenses anarchistic slogans. The one normal member of the household is Alice Sycamore (Jean Arthur), in love with wealthy Tony Kirby (James Stewart). Naturally, when the stuffy, aristocratic Kirbys come to the Sycamores for dinner, the event is a disaster, capped with the arrest of everyone in the household. Hart and Kaufmans third act found the previously judgmental Kirby softening his attitude toward the freewheeling Sycamore clan, admitting that hes never had so much fun in his life. Screenwriter Riskin altered the focus of the play by throwing out the third act and concentrating upon Tony Kirbys father, Kirby Sr., who as played by Edward Arnold is transformed from a stock stuffed shirt into a ruthless, grasping tycoon, eager to buy up every house on the Sycamores block to make room for a munitions plant. The film thus became the story of Kirbys regeneration at the hands of the carefree Sycamores. Enough of the plays screwball elements are retained to compensate for Riskins speechifying and plot distortions (though the softening of one of the plays vital ingredients, Grandpas refusal to pay his income tax, borders on the sacrilegious).

This prettified, idealized view of the upper-class British home front during World War II sometimes seems over-calculated and contrived when seen today. In particular, Greer Garsons Oscar-winning performance in the title role often comes off as artificial, especially when she nobly tends her rose garden while her stalwart husband (Walter Pidgeon) participates in the evacuation at Dunkirk. However, even if the film has lost a good portion of its ability to move and inspire audiences, it is easy to see why it was so popular in 1942-and why Winston Churchill was moved to comment that its propaganda value was worth a dozen battleships. Everyone in the audience-even English audiences, closer to the events depicted in the film than American filmgoers-liked to believe that he or she was capable of behaving with as much grace under pressure as the Miniver family. The films setpieces-the Minivers huddling in their bomb shelter during a Luftwaffe attack, Mrs. Miniver confronting a downed Nazi paratrooper in her kitchen, an annual flower show being staged despite the exigencies of bombing raids, cleric Henry Wilcoxons climactic call to arms from the pulpit of his ruined church-are masterfully staged and acted, allowing one to ever so briefly forget that this is, after all, slick propagandizing. In addition to Best Picture and Best Actress, Mrs. Miniver garnered Oscars for best supporting actress (Teresa Wright), best director (William Wyler), best script (Arthur Wimperis, George Froschel, James Hilton, Claudine West), best cinematography (Joseph Ruttenberg) and best producer (Sidney Franklin). Sidebar: Richard Ney, who plays Greer Garsons son, later married the actress-and still later became a successful Wall Street financier.

Crosby is cast as Father Chuck OMalley, newly arrived at rundown, heavily in debt St. Dominics Church. Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald), the cranky, set-in-his-ways curate of St. Dominics, is none too pleased with OMalleys breezy, ""modernistic"" methods. Fitzgibbon is content to adhere to the policies he has followed for nearly 45 years. Without overtly challenging Fitzgibbons authority (he likes the old buzzard, and the feeling is mutual), OMalley sets about to win the confidence of the local street toughs, organizing the boys into an angelic church choir. He also forestalls the plans of St. Dominics mortgage holder Ted Haines (Gene Lockhart) to evict Fitzgibbons by arranging a fundraising choir tour, to be headlined by OMalleys childhood friend, opera star Genevieve Linden (Rise Stevens). When hes not coming to the rescue of St. Dominics, OMalley is smoothing the path of romance for Haines son (James Brown) and orphaned Carol James (Jean Heather), and arranging for a reunion between Fitzgibbons and his nonagenarian Irish mother. There is sentiment by the bucketful in Going My Way, but director Leo McCarey sagaciously tempers the treacle with moments of genuine hilarity and several delightful (and seemingly spontaneous) musical interludes. In addition to Crosby, Oscars went to Barry Fitzgerald, Leo McCarey, screenwriters Frank Butler and Frank Cavett, and Burke and Van Heusens song hit ""Swingin On a Star.""

Hobson, this film stars Gregory Peck as recently widowed journalist Phil Green. With a growing son (Dean Stockwell) to support, Green is receptive to the invitation of magazine publisher John Minify (Albert Dekker) to write a series of hard-hitting articles on the scourge of anti-Semitism. In order to glean his information first hand, Green decides to pose as a Jew. As the weeks go by, Green experiences all manner of prejudice, the most insidious being the subtle, ""gentlemans agreement"" form of bigotry wherein anti-Jewish sentiments are merely taken for granted. Greens pose takes a toll on his budding romance with Minifys niece Kathy (Dorothy McGuire), who comes to realize by her own example that even those who insist that they harbor no anti-Semitic feelings are also capable of prejudice. Watching from the sidelines is Greens lifelong Jewish friend Dave (John Garfield, in what may be his best performance), who despite his inherent rage over the iniquities of racism has learned to be philosophical about the failings of his fellow man-but not to the extent that hes willing to give up the fight against blind hatred. Though warned by several Jewish film moguls that to produce the film would merely ""make trouble,"" 20th Century-Fox chieftan Daryl F. Zanuck (who was not himself Jewish) saw the project through to its conclusion.

The French Connection broke plenty of new ground for screen thrillers; Popeye Doyle was a highly unusual ""hero,"" an often violent, racist, and mean-spirited cop whose dedication to his job fell just short of dangerous obsession. The films high point, a high-speed car chase with Popeye tailing an elevated train, was one of the most viscerally exciting screen moments of its day and set the stage for dozens of action sequences to follow.

In adapting Avery Cormans novel, writer/director Robert Benton wisely altered the character of Joanna Kramer from a spiteful shrew to a well-meaning but confused woman who merely wants what she thinks is best for herself and her child. Benton also sagaciously removed a secondary romance between Michael Kramer and his platonic lady friend Margaret Phelps (Jane Alexander). By refusing to truckle to the Obvious, Benton transformed Kramer vs. Kramer from a standard marital-breakup tale to a film of rare depth and honesty. An incredible moneymaker, Kramer vs. Kramer also did well for itself at Oscar time, winning awards for Best Picture, Best Actor (Hoffman), Best Supporting Actress (Streep-but who was she supporting?), Best Screenplay and Best Director.",PG,Drama,Robert Benton,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,105 minutes,"Dustin Hoffman, Meryl Streep, Justin Henry"

Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a serious Christian Scotsman, believes that he has to succeed as a testament to his undying religious faith. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross), is a Jewish Englishman who wants desperately to be accepted and prove to the world that Jews are not inferior. The film crosscuts between each mans life as he trains for the competition, fueled by these very different desires. As compelling as the racing scenes are, its really the depth of the two main characters that touches the viewer, as they forcefully drive home the theme that victory attained through devotion, commitment, integrity, and sacrifice is the most admirable feat that one can achieve.

Discovering that the $3 million is being held in trust for an unidentified party, Charlie heads to his home town of Cincinnati to ascertain who that party is. It turns out that the beneficiary is Raymond Babbitt (Dustin Hoffman), the autistic-savant older brother that Charlie never knew he had. Able to memorize reams of trivia and add, subtract, multiply, and divide without a seconds hesitation, Raymond is otherwise incapable of functioning as a normal human being. Aghast that Raymond is to receive his fathers entire legacy, Charlie tries to cut a deal with Raymonds guardian. When this fails, Charlie ""borrows"" Raymond from the institution where he lives, hoping to use his brother as leverage to claim half the fortune. During their subsequent cross-country odyssey, Charlie is forced to accommodate Raymonds various autistic idiosyncracies, not the least of which is his insistence on adhering to a rigid daily schedule: he must, for example, watch Peoples Court and Jeopardy every day at the same time, no matter what. On hitting Las Vegas, Charlie hopes to harness Raymonds finely-honed mathematical skills to win big at the gaming tables; but this exploitation of his brothers affliction compels Charlie to reassess his own values, or lack thereof.

Patricia Arquette stars as Kristen, whose nightmare leads to a slashed wrist which looks suspiciously like a suicide attempt. She is placed in a hospital psychiatric ward with a group of six other troubled teens who all dream about the same horribly burned man (Robert Englund) trying to kill them. Perhaps the most unusual thing about this picture, however, is the unexpected depth of sadness running through it. There are some achingly sweet moments in this otherwise frightening film which, though not disruptive, are impossible to analyze. The first and most bizarre of these is Heather Langenkamps entrance, which inexplicably causes most viewers to get misty-eyed, and there are several similar scenes throughout the film. One answer can be found in the sensitive direction of Chuck Russell, who emphasizes the tragedy and utter hopelessness in these kids lives and manages to wring some unexpectedly perceptive turns from his cast. This is a film in which a great deal of care was obviously lavished on individual scenes (the sets are outstanding) and performances.

Credit must go to the effects team for some fine work, but otherwise, this entry from the director of Cutthroat Island (Renny Harlin) is extremely weak.

Suddenly prone to fits and bizarre behavior, Regan proves quite a handful for her actress-mother, Chris MacNeil (played by Ellen Burstyn, although Blatty reportedly based the character on his next-door neighbor Shirley MacLaine). When Regan gets completely out of hand, Chris calls in young priest Father Karras (Jason Miller), who becomes convinced that the girl is possessed by the Devil and that they must call in an exorcist: namely, Father Merrin (Max von Sydow). His foe proves to be no run-of-the-mill demon, and both the priest and the girl suffer numerous horrors during their struggles.

Regan attends frequent counseling sessions with Dr. Gene Tuskin, an unorthodox psychologist who believes Regan remembers more of her ordeal than she admits. Meanwhile, Father Lamont, a protégé of the priest who died exorcising Regan, is called to investigate the death of his mentor. The Church is divided over the teachings of Father Merrin and wants to gather documentation of his views about demonic existence. Father Lamont himself is conflicted -- haunted by images of a possessed woman he could not save. As he and Dr. Tuskin become convinced that the demon still exhibits a hold on Regan, the priest sojourns to Africa in search of Kokuma, who as a boy was possessed by the same demon and exorcised by Father Merrin.

Private eye Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) is hired by notorious gangster Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas) to find his mistress, Kathie Moffett (Jane Greer), who shot him and ran off with $40,000. Jeff traces Kathie to Mexico, but when he meets her he falls in love and willingly becomes involved in an increasingly complicated web of double-crosses, blackmail, and murder. Directed with supreme skill by Jacques Tourneur and brilliantly photographed by Nicholas Musuraca, this is an unrelentingly gloomy film set in a dark world of greed and deceit where love is used to trap the gullible. It was here that Mitchum created what became his characteristic screen persona: the droopy-eyed cynic who accepts fate with a studied nonchalance. Jane Greer is equally superb, perfecting the role of the femme fatale with a combination of erotic fire and cool detachment. Her first appearance in the film, in silhouette as she enters a dark cantina from the bright sunlight, is one of the great entrances in film history.

Outside an Atlantic City arena-hotel-casino, a TV news reporter stands in a pre-hurricane storm to report on the heavyweight boxing match about to begin inside. A transition to the stadium interior focuses on Atlantic City homicide Detective Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage), a father with a wife and son, yet also a dishonest cop who maintains a mistress and cheerfully accepts bribes. DePalmas Steadicam follows Santoro on a fast-paced tour of the stadium as the laughing, yelling detective travels stairs and hallways, talks to a gal with a between-rounds placard, visits the dressing room of champ Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw), rides down an escalator to squeeze money from a small-time hood, enters the arena of 14,000 fight fans, talks on his phone with his girlfriend and wife, and sits ringside next to his lifelong buddy, Navy Cmdr. Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise). Behind Dunne, the U.S. Secretary of Defense Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani) is seated alongside billionaire casino owner Gilbert Powell (John Heard). As the fight gets underway, Dunne abandons his position protecting the defense chief to pursue a suspicious redhead. From his ringside vantage point, Santoro has a close view of the champ, curiously conscious despite taking a kayo punch. At that moment, an assassin fires at Kirkland. Santoro immediately concocts a good cover story for his pal (to explain why Dunne left his post protecting Kirkland). Just after the shooting, Dunne kills a Palestinian extremist, the apparent killer, and Santoro orders the stadium doors locked, hoping he can locate other suspects among the fleeing crowd. One such is Julia Costello (Carla Gugino), an injured woman in a blond wig who spoke with Kirkland seconds before the gunfire. After a video replay reveals the champ took a fall, going down to the floor from a punch that never touched him, Santoro becomes more curious and suspicious, comparing witness accounts, and he attempts to locate Julia, convinced shes the key to truth behind the assassination. As it all comes to a head, Santoro peels through successive layers of corruption, ultimately confronting himself in a self-examination of his own values.

It doesnt pull any punches. Death -- violent, disturbing death -- is ever present, portrayed in a manner that is astonishingly honest for a cartoon. As a result, it is that rare animated film that really aims for a mature audience, despite its superficial funny animal trappings. It has a brilliant opening, most likely created by UPA veteran John Hubley, which in a primitive and simplistic style relates a creation myth as told by rabbits. The style changes thereafter, with beautiful watercolor backgrounds and a more natural approach to character animation. Unfortunately, the animation suffers somewhat from this point, becoming a bit sloppy, although it continues to portray the characters movements as realistically as possible. The character designs themselves are rather too similar, with the result that it is sometimes difficult to tell the various rabbits apart. The story is also sometimes told in too-broad strokes, leaving those unfamiliar with the novel confused as to exactly what has happened and, more importantly, why. However, these flaws are redeemed by some unforgettable sequences, including a chilling segment detailing the destruction of the rabbits warren and a devastatingly sad end sequence in which the Black Rabbit of Death gently takes one of the heroes away with it. Voiced by a fine cast, with stellar work from John Hurt and Richard Briers, Watership Down is an imperfect film with some of the most powerful moments ever created for the genre. ~ Craig Butler, Rovi",PG,"Animation, Drama, Kids & Family",Martin Rosen,WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES,92 minutes,"John Hurt, Richard Briers, Michael Graham Cox"

Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast, the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castevets circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth, and the baby is taken away from her. Polanskis camerawork and Richard Sylberts production design transform the realistic setting (shot on-location in Manhattans Dakota apartment building) into a sinister projection of Rosemarys fears, chillingly locating supernatural horror in the familiar by leaving the most grotesque frights to the viewers imagination. This apocalyptic yet darkly comic paranoia about the hallowed institution of childbirth touched a nerve with late-60s audiences feeling uneasy about traditional norms. Produced by B-horror maestro William Castle, Rosemarys Baby became a critically praised hit, winning Gordon an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Inspiring a wave of satanic horror from The Exorcist (1973) to The Omen (1976), Rosemarys Baby helped usher in the genres modern era by combining a supernatural story with Alfred Hitchcocks propensity for finding normality horrific. ~ Lucia Bozzola, Rovi","R (adult situations/language, violence)","Classics, Horror, Mystery & Suspense",Roman Polanski,Paramount Pictures,136 minutes,"Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes, Ruth Gordon"

One day he decides to play hooky and walks into a strange bookstore, where in the attic, he discovers a book called ""The Neverending Story"".

Goyer adaptation of the Marvel Comics character created in 1973 by scripter Marv Wolfman and artist Gene Colan. In the Tomb of Dracula comic book origin, just before Blades mother gave birth to Blade, she was bitten by a vampire, which made Blade immune to vampires. Now a vampire hunter, Blade, joined by vampire detective Hannibal King and Dracula-descendent Frank Drake, stalks vampires.

The Marvel origin is retold in this 1998 Norrington film, with Blades mother dying as he is born. Thirty-some years later, Blade now exists somewhere between the two worlds, not human but not fully vampire. He has become a relentless and superhuman vampire hunter, out to avenge the death of his mother and protect the rest of humankind from the evil vampire race. In this pursuit, Blade storms a notorious vampire nightclub and in a virtual bloodbath manages to wipe out most of the blood-lusting denizens. But the burnt corpse of vampire Quinn (Donal Logue) is reanimated at the hospital morgue and bites hematologist Karen Jenson (NBushe Wright).

Meanwhile, Blades vampire arch-nemesis Deacon Frost (Stephen Dorff) uses computers to translate the Book of Erebus, with the ultimate aim of bringing down the old-guard vampire council, headed by Dragonetti (Udo Kier), and triggering the Blood Tide -- an event in which everyone in the world becomes a vampire. ~ Bhob Stewart, Rovi","R (for strong, pervasive vampire violence and gore, language, and brief sexuality)","Action & Adventure, Horror, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Stephen Norrington,New Line Cinema,121 minutes,"Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff, Kris Kristofferson"

In Rope, Hitchcock attempted the daunting technical challenge of filming the entire picture in one long, seemingly uninterrupted take. Actually, there are several edits in the movie: since a reel of film was divided into two ten-minute minireels back in 1948, the internal reel-breaks are ""fudged"" by having a dark object briefly obscure the camera lens, sustaining the illusion that no editing has taken place.",PG,"Classics, Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Alfred Hitchcock,Warner Bros.

After a day or so of floating aimlessly about, the castaways pick up another passenger, Willy (Walter Slezak), who is a survivor from the German U-boat. At first everyone assumes that Willy cannot speak English, but when the necessity arises he reveals himself to be conversant in several languages and highly intelligent; in fact, he was the U-boats captain. As the only one on board with any sense of seamanship, Willy steers a course to his mother ship, while the others resign themselves to being prisoners of war. After it becomes necessary to amputate Guss leg, Willy decides that the burly stoker is excess weight; while the others sleep, he tosses Gus overboard, watching dispassionately as the poor man drowns. When the rest of the passengers discover what hes done, all of them (with one significant exception) violently gang up on Gus, and once more, the lifeboat drifts about sans navigation. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",NR,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Alfred Hitchcock,20th Century Fox,100 minutes,"Tallulah Bankhead, John Hodiak, Walter Slezak"

As the story begins, Hong-Kong supercop Lees (Chan), detective savvy leads to the confiscation of $500 million in weapons, drugs, and Chinese art. When Hong Kong Chinese Consul Han (Tzi Ma), is sent on a diplomatic mission to Los Angeles, his 11-year-old daughter, Soo Young (Julia Hsu), is abducted by an international criminal mastermind.

In a shocking opening scene, teen Danny Vinyard (Edward Furlong) races to tell his older brother, neo-Nazi Derek (Edward Norton), about the young blacks breaking into his car in front of the house, whereupon Derek gets his gun and with no forethought shoots the youths in their tracks. Tried and convicted, Derek is sent away for three years in prison, where he acquires a different outlook as he contrasts white-power prisoners with black Lamont (Guy Torry), his prison laundry co-worker and eventual pal. Meanwhile, Danny, with a shaved head and a rebellious attitude, seems destined to follow in his big brothers footsteps. After Danny writes a favorable review of Hitlers Mein Kampf, black high-school principal Sweeney (Avery Brooks) puts Danny in his private ""American History X"" course and assigns him to do a paper about his older brother, who was a former student of Sweeneys. This serves to introduce flashbacks, with the film backtracking to illustrate Dannys account of Dereks life prior to the night of the shooting. Monochrome sequences of Derek leading a Venice, California gang are intercut with color footage of the mature Derek ending his past neo-Nazi associations and attempting to detour Danny away from the group led by white supremacist, Cameron (Stacy Keach), who once influenced Derek.

Boddys butler, Wadsworth (Tim Curry), assigns each guest a colorful name: Mr. Green (Michael McKean), Col. Mustard (Martin Mull), Mrs. Peacock (Eileen Brennan), Professor Plum (Christopher Lloyd), Miss Scarlet (Lesley Ann Warren), and Mrs. White (Madeline Kahn). Two additional servants, the Cook (Kellye Nakahara) and Yvette, the maid (Colleen Camp), assist Wadsworth as he informs the guests that they have been gathered to meet the man who has been blackmailing them: Mr. Boddy. When Boddy turns up dead, however, the guests must try to figure out who killed him so they can protect their own reputations and keep the body count from growing. Three separate endings were filmed for Clue and shown in different theaters; all three are collected for the video edition. Although the film is set in the 1950s, the original Clue game was actually devised by Anthony Pratt, a clerk in Leeds, England, to pass the time during World War II air-raid drills. First released in 1946 under the name Cluedo by British manufacturer Waddingtons, Clue was renamed and released in the U.S. in 1949. Today, Clue/Cluedo is marketed in 70 countries around the world and has been adapted into a British game show and an off-Broadway musical. ~ Brian J.

One such unlucky reptile is ""Ramon,"" who survives in the subterranean cesspool by feeding on the steroid-saturated carcasses of dogs dumped there by chemical company researchers and eventually bulks up to the size of a Winnebago. When assorted sewage workers start disappearing into Ramons massive maw, hard-boiled cop David Madison (Robert Forster), who has a history of unlucky partners, reveals a strong personal interest in the case. Deemed a jinx and a nutcase by his superiors, hes kicked off the force and must go underground (literally) to destroy the beast with the help of young reptile-expert Marion (Robin Riker). The witty screenplay is filled with clever references, eccentric characters and in-jokes aplenty (a style reflective of Joe Dantes Piranha and The Howling, both of which Sayles also scripted), which combines with decent effects and a good amount of suspense (particularly in the sewer scenes) to make this an entertaining romp overall.

Josie (played by Drew Barrymore) is a 25-year-old copy editor at a newspaper in Chicago. But its her youthful looks as much as her journalistic skills that finally win her a writing assignment: shes ordered to enroll in high school posing as a teenager for a story on the state of Americas youth. Trouble is, Josie was a hopeless nerd in high school (called ""Josie Grossie"" by her classmates); she had no idea of how to fit in with the cool kids, and shes hardly gotten any better at it in the seven years since graduation. While Josie makes fast friends with a bookish girl named Aldys (Leelee Sobieski), and also takes notice of her good-looking English teacher Mr. Coulson (Michael Vartan), she realizes for the sake of her story she has to infiltrate the cool girls clique, which will be impossible without someone to give her a crash course in hipness.

Jewel is watched over by her middle-aged black caretaker (Charles Dutton), but she misses her recently departed husband, Buck, and contemplates joining him in the hereafter. When Jewel finally decides to pull the trigger, Camille stumbles into the situation and plots a coverup that rapidly spins out of control. Close is near perfect as the singleminded southern dame who brooks no interference with her willful desires, whether shes directing the towns Easter play, Salome, or pushing her way through police tape.

Ray spots would-be bank teller Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) at a gambling spot and, figuring him for an easy mark, lifts his wallet -- only to discover Claude is broke. Ray and Claudes mutual need to raise some cash brings them together when Spanky offers them a job bringing back a load of moonshine from bootleggers in the deep south. However, things dont go well for Ray and Claude, and theyre arrested by a sheriff in Mississippi who recently killed a man and needs someone on whom he can hang the charge. Since Ray and Claude are black, from out of town and have been caught red-handed with a load of illegal liquor, the sheriff figures theyre easy pickings and frames them for the murder. Soon the two men are inmates in a Southern work camp, where they spend the next 55 years learning to get along with the other inmates, avoiding the wrath of the guards, seeing younger prisoners come and go and never losing hope that someday, somehow, their innocence will be proven and theyll be released.
