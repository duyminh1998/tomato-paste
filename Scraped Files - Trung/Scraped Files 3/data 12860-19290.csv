At the crux of these tumultuous three years is the war in Vietnam, which forces Johnson (here played by Michael Gambon) to shunt his proposed ""Great Society"" to the back burner. Though famous in political circles as a wrangler and compromiser, LBJ cannot seem to do anything right in pursuing the war; nor are his chief advisors, the hawkish Robert McNamara (Alec Baldwin) and the dove-ish Clark Clifford (Donald Sutherland), able to forge a permanent policy agreement. As Clifford warns Johnson that ""escalation will ruin you, and all the great good you want to do,"" McNamara presses for a continuation of the war lest America lose face and Vietnam fall to the Communists. The story unfolds with the inexorability of a Shakespearean tragedy, with Johnson as a modern-day Macbeth, Richard III, and King Lear rolled into one. Of interest to non-history buffs is the appearance of two original cast members of the 1969 film M*A*S*H: Donald Sutherland as Clark Clifford and Tom Skerritt as William Westmoreland. Directed by political-movie veteran John Frankenheimer, Path to War made its HBO cable network debut on May 18, 2002.",PG-13,"Drama, Television",John Frankenheimer,HBO Video,165 minutes,"Michael Gambon, Donald Sutherland, Alec Baldwin"

Price and his guests were viciously slaughtered in the refurbished mansion. Though the authorities officially blamed Price himself for the gruesome massacre, survivor Sarah Wolfe insists that there was indeed a supernatural element at play. Now, eight years have passed since that fateful night, and Sarahs sister Ariel - a successful editor at a popular mens fashion magazine - has just received word that Sarah has committed suicide. Immediately sensing foul play, Ariels suspicions are confirmed when a strange book arrives in the mail shortly thereafter.

According to the diary, which Ariel manages to translate with a little help from archeologist Richard Hammer, an ancient Baphomet idol is hidden somewhere deep within the sprawling estate. In her last days, Sarah had become convinced that the idol was the source of the houses evil. Richard, too, shares this belief, and with the help of graduate students Michelle and Kyle he is determined to find the idol.

Its been more than a decade since five hunters were swept out of the forest and into the night skies by a powerful otherworldly force, but only four of the lifelong friends ever found their way back to terra firma. In the wake of that inexplicable tragedy the remaining friends found their bond growing stronger than ever before.

Years later, upon capturing one of the very same creatures that caused all of their suffering, the four friends retreat into a remote forest compound to execute their long awaited revenge. To set the creature free would be to sign their own death warrants, and to kill it would almost certainly spell their doom as well.

It seems the mobster has a package that he needs delivered to Bucharest, and hes willing to pay Ovidiu a healthy wad of cash to do the job. Ovidiu isnt sure whats in the package (and is smart enough not to ask), but he figures its an easy way to make some fast money, so he packs up his van and hits the road, with his girlfriend (Ioana Flora) and another pal (Dragos Bucur) tagging along for company. Assuming theyre carrying some sort of contraband, Ovidiu and his friends have to steer clear of police cars and check points along the way, but before long the law is the least of Ovidius worries when he discovers that a red car is following them -- and the four men inside are determined not to be shaken.

Nick (Andrew Howard) and Sammy (Polly Brown) were just two horny with time to kill and a pocket full of drugs. Upon discovering an abandoned asylum, the pair ventures inside and finds a bizarre contraption that appears to be a cross between an electric chair and a sadistic fetish device. It seems that this chair has the power to transform chemical bliss into unimaginable despair, and when Sammy is assaulted and brutally slain by an unknown force Nick becomes the number one suspect in her murder. Years later, after being held in a high security mental hospital, Nick is released into the care of his psychiatrist Dr. Willard (David Gant). Dr. Gant suspects that there is more to this murder than the authorities realize, and in order to prove it he organizes a special field trip to the decrepit asylum where Sammy was slain. Accompanying Nick and Dr. Willard on their excursion are a group of Dr. Willards most prestigious students. But Nick has been diagnosed as clinically insane, and years of psychiatric treatment have irreversibly altered his perception of reality. Now, as the brutal, blood-soaked truth emerges from the darkness intent on destroying everything in its path, Nick will have to overcome demons of both the psychological and supernatural varieties if he holds out any hope of ending the slaughter and proving his sanity. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",NR,Horror,Adam Mason,Sony Pictures Home Entertainment,91 minutes,"Andrew Howard, Elize DuToit, David Gant"

The title initially refers to a mysterious piece of technology capable of generating a powerful bio-mechanical exoskeleton around the body of its operator. After scientist Tetsu Segawa (Greg Paik) is murdered while trying to deliver it to CIA agent Max Reed (Mark Hamill), the device is stumbled upon by Sean Barker (Jack Armstrong), a friend of the scientists daughter Mizki (Vivian Wu). Sean discovers the objects power when it encases him with protective power-armor during a fight -- armor which comes in handy when the similarly-clad minions of the diabolical Chronos Corporation come after him to reclaim it. The technology they employ is revealed to be from another planet, which has enabled the head of Chronos (David Gale) to transform his henchmen into reptilian creatures known as Zoanoids (whose ranks include Jimmie Walker from the 70s TV sitcom Good Times!). In the ensuing battle, Seans consciousness becomes merged with the power of the Guyver, bestowing him with remarkable strength and agility, as well as the convenient ability to regenerate himself when damaged. Helmed by Kung Fu Rascals creator Steve Wang and special-effects wizard Screaming Mad George, The Guyver is a colorful but ultimately clumsy comic-book adventure, bogged down by a pedestrian ""Hollywood"" script that seems out-of-lace amid the exotic premise and fanciful creature designs. Apparently targeted at younger audiences -- who may enjoy the broad comedy and wild monster effects -- this is relatively safe sci-fi fare compared to its ultra-violent source material.

Laurence Stalllings screenplay is based on several short stories by Kentucky humorist Irvin S. Cobb, some of which had previously been cinematized in Fords 1934 Will Rogers vehicle Judge Priest. Charles Winninger stars as Judge William Pittman Priest, whose down-home, common-sense approach to his job has endeared himself to most of the residents of his small Kentucky home town, while alienating many of the ""better"" people. Up for election, Judge Priest is challenged by a Yankee upstart who has most of the influential citizens in his pocket. Almost deliberately courting defeat, the doggedly honest Priest champions several unpopular causes. In the films most memorable scene, the Judge arranges a fancy funeral procession for an impoverished town prostitute. The film retains much of the charm of its predecessor Judge Priest; unfortunately (at least by P.C. standards), The Sun Shines Bright also retains the most questionable aspect of the earlier film: the stereotyped routines of African-American comedian Stepin Fetchit. One hardly knows how to react to the sequence in which the supplicative Fetchit tries to hush up a defiant young black man who is in danger of being lynched (Ford plays this scene for laughs!) While Fetchits participation will hardly endear the film to modern audiences, it is unfair to write off the rest of The Sun Shines Bright, which otherwise fully lives up to director Fords affectionate assessment.

Then, in the films most compelling section, Rubbo examines Shakespeares background, questioning the Bards capacity to have written the work attributed to him.

In the 1980s, punk rock was strictly an underground movement, and for every Ramones, Clash, and Sex Pistols making a mark on the mainstream there were ten UK Subs and Subhumans delivering some of the most ferocious, outrageous music ever conceived. In the 1990s, the music that once shocked the masses gradually became commercialized through the likes of Green Day, Rancid, and Nirvana. By the time such bands as Good Charlotte and Sum 41 hit the scene in the first years of the 21st century, the vitality and urgency that once defined punk rock had largely been lost in radio friendly riffs and lyrics that were more concerned with typical teenage issues than the current state of politics and globalization. So what exactly happened to the non-conformist spirit of punk?

Too much time is afforded the wheezy old plotline about two World War I aviators (Buddy Rogers, Richard Arlen) in love with the same woman (Jobyna Ralston), while the comedy relief of El Brendel is decidedly not to everyones taste. But during the aerial ""dogfight"" sequences, the film is something else again: a grand-scale spectacular, the likes of which has never been duplicated, not even by more expensive efforts like Hells Angels (1930) and The Blue Max (1965). Twenty-eight-year-old director William Wellman, himself a wartime aviator, was fortunate enough to have the full cooperation of the US War department at his disposal (even though his legendary temper nearly lost him that cooperation on more than one occasion!) Brilliantly handled though the aerial scenes may be, they are matched by the Earthbound combat sequences, including the now-famous shot of a long trench caving in on hundreds of unfortunate doughboys. The storyline is as follows: Jack Powell (Rogers) and David Armstrong (${Powell}) hate each other during basic training, grow to like each other, and fall out again while competing for the affections of Sylvia Lewis (Ralston). Mary Preston (Clara Bow) sacrifices her own nursing career to save a drunken Powell from disgrace, Powell goes on a rampage when he believes his pal Armstrong has been killed, inadvertently shoots down Armstrong while decimating the German air corps, and is finally reunited with the nurse. Wrapped up in nurses garb throughout most of the film, the ebullient Clara Bow is permitted a sequence in which, disguised as a Parisian floozie while trying to rescue a revelling Rogers, she displays a great deal of epidermis. One of the films chief claims to fame is its ""introduction"" of Gary Cooper (whod actually been in films since the early 1920s), in a brief but crucial role as veteran flyer with a cheerily fatalistic attitude. When originally released, Wings included a sequence lensed in the wide-screen ""Magnascope"" process; even when seen ""flat"", however, the film contains some of the best flying sequences ever captured on celluloid. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",PG-13,"Action & Adventure, Classics",William Wellman,Unknown,144 minutes,"Clara Bow, Charles 'Buddy' Rogers, Richard Arlen"

Duke Holliday (Robert Mitchum), an American army lieutenant, is on his way to Mexico by boat when hes confronted in his cabin by Blake (William Bendix), gun in hand, who plans on taking him back to the United States. Holliday gets away, pummeling Blake pretty hard in the bargain and stealing his identification, and crosses paths with Joan Graham (Jane Greer).

These four end up playing cat-and-mouse across Veracruz, with Fiske always a half-step ahead, while police Inspector General Ortega (Ramon Novarro) calmly keeps tabs on all of them, trying to figure out (along with the rest of us) exactly who is on the level (in those days, especially after Out of the Past, there was no built-in assurance for audiences that Mitchum and Greer played characters with clean hands, and Mitchum is almost too good with the rough stuff here to be an obvious hero). Holliday and Graham engage in some surprisingly playful and suggestive banter during their travels, in between her keeping Holliday -- whose command of Spanish is less than minimal -- from adding too many new permutations to the phrase ""the ugly American"" in his dealings with the Mexicans. The mood is decidedly brisk and light-hearted at times, given the gunplay and violence that explodes at key intervals.

Though the BBC functioned as the countrys main source of news and music, its programmers offered very little airtime to rock & roll -- which left an overwhelming need unfulfilled. In response, small bands of ""pirate"" radio enthusiasts set up broadcasting towers on boats just outside of English boundary waters, and transmitted signals to an estimated 25 million listeners, 24 hours a day and seven days per week. Unsurprisingly, the DJs who took charge of these broadcasts could rival just about anyone in terms of flamboyance and outsized personalities. With Pirate Radio (released as The Boat That Rocked in the U.K.), writer-director Richard Curtis (Love Actually) travels back to the Swinging Sixties and takes a headfirst plunge into this colorful realm.

Previously managed by Cloughs bitter rival Don Revie, the Leeds team had just completed its most successful period ever as a football club. It was perceived by many to represent a new aggressive and cynical style of football--an anathema to the principled yet flamboyant Clough, who had achieved astonishing success as manager of Hartlepool and Derby County. He had built these teams in his own vision with trusty lieutenant Peter Taylor.

Langdon plays a Belgian soldier who, during World War I, is captured by German conscript Arthur Thalasso. Almost immediately, the armistice is declared. Having nowhere else to go, Langdon sticks with Thalasso, who in civilian life is a popular circus strong man. When Thalasso gets the opportunity to tour the US, Langdon is delighted; at last he will meet ministers daughter Priscilla Bonner, with whom he has been carrying on a romance-by-correspondence. Arriving in New York, Harry wanders around the street with a photo of Bonner, asking passers-by if they know the girl. Jewel thief Gertrude Astor, hoping to use Langdon as a dupe in order to evade the cops, claims that she is the girl hes looking for. A marvelous comic set piece ensues, beginning with Langdons clumsy efforts to carry the unconscious Astor up a long flight of stairs, and ending with Astors athletic ""seduction"" of the confused little immigrant. When Langdon finally finds the real Bonner, he discovers she is blind--just as well, he reasons, since she regards him as something of a strong, strapping hero-type, which he most decidedly is not. Subsequent plot complications involve a corrupt element that has taken over Priscillas town, and a wild climactic sequence wherein puny Langdon must try to pass himself off as strong man Thalasso...and through plain dumb luck, gets away with it! Far better seen than described, The Strong Man is one of the sweetest, funniest comedies of the 1920s.

The story is told within the framework of three men waiting at a railway station. A con-man (Edward G. Robinson) listens to the account of a trial held recently in the town as told by a prospector (Howard Da Silva) and a preacher (William Shatner) suffering from a crisis of faith in humanity. Three witnesses at the trial of a Mexican outlaw give conflicting testimony. Each version is shown in flashback. The outlaw, Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman), confesses that he bound the husband (Laurence Harvey), raped the wife, and killed the husband in a duel of honor. The wife (Claire Bloom) claims that the outlaw raped her, and then she stabbed her husband when he contemptuously blamed her for inviting the assault. The third witness, an old Indian (Paul Fix), declares that he found the dying husband who stated that he stabbed himself because he couldnt live with the humiliation. At this point, the narrative is interrupted by an abandoned babys cry. The child has gold hidden in his clothing which the con-man attempts to appropriate. Then the discussion of the trial continues, turning brusquely from drama to parody. The prospector admits that he witnessed the rape, but that the wife nagged the two men into fighting over her. The husband tripped and fell on his own knife. The prospector, who stole the jeweled knife from the dead body, chose not to appear in court. Possibly out of some desire for redemption, the prospector decided to care for the abandoned baby, and the preacher regains faith from the supposed altruistic action. The eerily deserted train station and the strong black-and-white cinematography contribute a mild surreal quality to the film, but can do little to save the story from its flaws. The changes in the characters necessary to accommodate the new setting cause them to lose important symbolic significance in the translation. Despite a star cast and strong acting, the new version is mediocre at best.

Hes unable to get away from his past, even though the Old West is fading fast in the face of civilization -- in fact, the fading of the West is making matters worse, as ordinary folks are mostly scared of and curious about him. Additionally, he still has enemies all around, who will give him no peace; and to top it off, the only man willing to give him any kind of a job is Dan Ruffalo (Vincent Price), operator of a Wild West show, as a sharpshooter. It turns out that Cain isnt even that perfect a shot anymore, but Cain still becomes the shows biggest attraction, because people will pay to see -- or say they saw -- a killer, and that upsets young Billy (Paul Hampton), Ruffalos other sharpshooter, who never misses but has also never killed a man either. Billy is a lot more frightening to Cain than Cain could ever be to Billy, because Billy turns out to be a psychopath. Adding to his troubles is the presence of Luke Santee (Mike Henry), a killer with his own score to settle with Cain, as well as Karma (Craig Littler), a mysterious lawyer whos been looking for him.

Taking place in the 19th century during the revolution, it centers on Dietrich, a Spanish seductress with a spider-like tendency to destroy the lives of those who love her. The film opens as Galvan, a young soldier encounters the beautiful vamp and instantly falls in love. Later he tells this to his buddy Don Pasqual who is horrified to learn that she is the same vixen who destroyed his life. Attempting to warn his friend, he tells his grim story, which unfolds via flashback. It all began five years ago when he met and fell in love with her on a train. The wealthy Don Pasqual becomes obsessed with the woman and begins showering her with gifts, favors, and a posh apartment. His nagging, over-bearing mother disapproves of the affair and for good reason. Soon the woman takes the smitten Don Pasqual for everything and then demands more. The masochistic fellow is more than happy to comply and so goes off in search of more money. Not long afterward, she callously dumps him. Later, after restoring his fortune, he finds her dancing in a bar in Cadiz. Once again he gives her everything he has, and again she leaves. And so it goes. The younger fellow is impressed by the story and promises to try and stay away from her, but like his friend he too is weak and in the end, tragedy for one of the men ensues.

Though seldom discussed in history books (and reportedly undisclosed for half a century), fascist dictator Benito Mussolini conceived an illegitimate son by a woman named Ida Dalser -- a son Mussolini allowed to be born, acknowledged, and then promptly denied for the duration of his life. The tale begins in early 20th century Milan, with Benito (Fabrizio Costella) working as the socialist editor of a controversial newspaper called Avanti. His dream in life involves triumphantly leading the Italian masses away from monarchy and toward a ""socially emancipated future."" He met the young and wealthy Ida (Giovanna Mezzogiorno) once before, in Trento -- where they enjoyed a brief exchange; they re-encounter one another during Mussolinis period at Avanti and it becomes clear that Ida has fallen deeply in love with Benito. She believes wholeheartedly in his ideals and his future as the leader of Italy -- to such an extent that she sells everything she has (her apartment, furniture, jewelry, and the beauty salon she owns) to fuel the development of his newspaper, Il Popolo dItalia.While the two become romantically entangled, with Ida positively magnetized by Benitos charisma and Benito hooked on a lust for power, Benito quickly switches spiritual and political allegiances overnight, changing from an atheistic socialist to a deeply Catholic fascist -- Catholic, because an allegiance with the Vatican will enable him to wrest and retain control over Italys government. Benito and Ida marry and parent a son together, Benito Albino Mussolini (circa 1915), but the marriage certificate soon conveniently disappears and Ida learns, to her horror, that Benito has married someone else. She unwisely begins to protest the situation -- so loudly and persistently that shes first forced into house arrest and then shoved permanently into an insane asylum -- raising key questions about the fate and future of her young son. On a stylistic level, director Marco Bellocchio films this historical material with the passion, theatricality, lyricism, and tragedy of a classical Italian opera. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Drama",Marco Bellocchio,IFC Films,128 minutes,"Giovanna Mezzogiorno, Fabrizio Costella, Filippo Timi"

There, Aileen met Selby Wall (Christina Ricci), a woman in her early twenties who had been sent to live with relatives after her Christian parents became aware of her lesbian lifestyle. Selby is immediately attracted to Aileen, and while Aileen tells Selby shes never been in a lesbian relationship, she soon finds herself equally infatuated with her. Selby runs away from her family and moves into a cheap hotel with Aileen, who initially pays the bills by hooking. However, as their money runs low and Aileen finds herself unable to land a regular job, tensions mount between the two. One night, after a john attacks her, Aileen pulls a gun and kills the man. Although her first murder can be categorized as self-defense, Aileens loathing for the men who pay her for sex becomes so extreme that she begins killing her customers regardless of their behavior. Meanwhile, Selby slowly becomes aware of the full extent of her lovers instability and the bloody consequences of her actions.

Surrounded by strife but left with little choice other to wait until his car is repaired, the anxious Freidoune is soon approached by persistent local Zahra (Shohreh Aghdashloo), who convinces him to follow her into the courtyard behind her home. There, she reveals to him that she has just borne witness to a most heinous crime. Just the previous day, Zahra had watched the men or her town stone an innocent woman to death. That woman was Soraya (Mozhan Marnò), long-suffering wife of abusive tyrant Ali. Soraya wed Ali in an arranged marriage, never realizing the horrors that she and her children would endure under her husbands heavy hand. When Ali requested a divorce so that he would be free to marry a 14-year-old girl, Soraya boldly refused, knowing that she and the children would most certainly starve to death without a husband to support them. Ali was too poor to return Sorayas dowry as custom dictates in a divorce, but he found another way out of the marriage. Under Shariah law, adultery is a crime punishable by death if the accused is unable to prove her innocence. Scheming with the newly installed, counterfeit mullah, Ali accused his wife of adultery. In order to ensure that she had no chance of defending herself, he blackmailed several male villagers to testify on his behalf. A tribunal was quickly called, and Sorayas fate forever sealed. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","R (for a disturbing sequence of cruel and brutal violence, and brief strong language)",Drama,,Roadside Attractions,114 minutes,"Shima Poorsadeghi, Navid Negahban, Jim Caviezel"

That same year, a dark secret Rose had been hiding for years came to the surface -- Rose had for years been dealing with an addiction to gambling, and after falling deep in debt to bookies by betting on horse racing, he attempted to make the money back by betting on baseball, including wagering on his own team and his own games. These revelations led to Rose being banned from professional baseball, a stay in prison when an IRS investigation discovered he had failed to pay taxes on sale of memorabilia, and a decision that would prevent him from entering the Baseball Hall of Fame, though Rose denied the gambling allegations. (In his 2004 autobiography, Rose finally confessed that he did gamble on baseball but denied betting on his own teams.) Hustle stars Tom Sizemore as Pete Rose in this biographical drama produced for the cable sports network ESPN, which chronicles Roses rise to fame, his fall from grace as he became involved with gambling, and Roses ongoing fight to be inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Room 100, the Chelsea Hotel - a faded 19th century façade masking, a clientele of junkies. The floor of the tiny en-suite bathroom is covered in blood. And, slumped between the toilet and the sink is the body of a woman, peroxide blonde in black bra and panties. She is Nancy Spungen, a twenty year old, heroin addicted, former stripper, prostitute and groupie. She also has the accolade of being Sid Vicious girlfriend, to add to her crimes! A trail of blood leads to the bedroom where an NYPD detective - watched by his partner and six uniform officers - is slapping the aforementioned Sid, until minutes ago out cold on a concoction of drugs that might have killed a horse, across the face. He comes round. And seeing hes got an audience, gives way to bravado: ""Go on, arrest me. Im a dog, a dirty dog. I did it and I deserve everything I get, shoot me, kill me!"" Sid was arrested and charged with the murder but the case never came to trial and many questions remained unanswered. His guilt unproven and his innocence proclaimed. Alan G Parker sets out on his journey to discover the truth. Nancy is a regular on the punk scene with a talent for giving great blow jobs and a taste for musicians and heroin. Legend has it that she slept with every member of one major band, in one night! The men use her then lose her. The women brand her ""Nauseating Nancy"". But Nancys determined, ballsy. She knows what she wants and shell do anything to make sure she gets it. When the Heartbreakers leave for London on tour, Nancy follows and washes up at SEX, the Kings Road clothes shop run by McLaren and his girlfriend, Vivienne Westwood looking for Jerry Nolan, the drummer in the Heartbreakers Sids debut is at the Notre Dame Hall, just off Leicester Square. Dressed in trainers, jeans with the knees ripped out and a Vive Le Rock T-shirt and a brand new Fender Precision bass, he looks every inch the star. He hogs the mic. He steals the limelight. Watching, in the audience is a bottle blonde in black jeans, a black leather jacket, studded belt and a string mohair jumper bought from SEX: Nancy. She is accompanied by Linda Ashby, a junkie prostitute and already a Sex Pistols insider. Nancy and Sid wake up in bed together. Its morning, 11am - and this girl hasnt left yet. Sid thinks she must be his girlfriend. And from that day on, she is. Friends remember the birth of the co-dependent relationship of this modern day Romeo and Juliet that could only end one way: badly. Its 1977 - Jubilee year, the Pistols at their height sacked by A&M Records and picked up by Virgin in a matter of weeks, they achieve the worlds first banned number 1 single - and the inseparable Sid and Nancy are joined at the hip, living on a diet of sex, punk and heroin. There are fights. Sid downs a bottle of vodka, turns to the heroin and tries to throw himself out of a third floor hotel window. Nancy saves him by grabbing his belt. Shes thanked when he takes out his frustrations on the hotel furnishings and her. A few short months and a disastrous US tour later, the band is finished. The victims of too much to soon, and their own now growing egos. Sid returns home to Nancy and heroin. They hole themselves up in a love-nest in Pindock Mews. Steve Dior, the only surviving member of Sids solo group, remembers going round for dinner - ""I didnt know you could ruin fish fingers and beans, but she managed it"". Domestic bliss it is not. When Dead on Arrival director Lech Kowalski turns up to the flat to film Sid and Nancy, all he gets is footage of them lounging in bed, Sid in sunglasses and barely conscious, clutching a scotch and coke and Nancy lighting his cigarettes and finishing his sentences. They look like corpses in waiting. McLaren is trying to keep the idea of the Sex Pistols alive with Sid as front man. With Nancy in tow, they go to Paris. Sid records his iconic version of My Way. But hes a physical wreck and almost impossible to work with. Nancy has other plans anyway. She usurps McLaren as Sids manager. Sid and Nancy put together a show with the help of Glen Matlock, the man Sid replaced in the Sex Pistols. His fellow Rich Kid Steve New and Rat Scabies. The Vicious White Kids play an amazing one-off gig. Sid and Nancy pocket the proceeds and head to America. Sid and Nancy unpack in room 100 of New Yorks Chelsea Hotel - Sids gold records, a Never Mind the Bollocks poster and an innocuous-looking Fairy Liquid bottle. In it is the couples stash of Methadone and Nancys scrapbook, filled with cuttings on the legend that is and can only be - their own. Sids gigs are getting him a reputation. Hes out of it, cutting himself, getting bloody. Backstage, Nancy takes her revenge on the US crowd that had shut her out before she went to England, jealously controlling contact with Sid, not letting those whod shunned her anywhere near her very own rock star. For the first time in her life, shes in charge. 12th October, 1978. Room 100, the Chelsea Hotel. The Never Mind the Bollocks poster unpacked that summer is littered with needles. Sids gold discs are spattered with blood. And Sid is being led away by the NYPD. Hes taken from the hotel to be arraigned at a New York courthouse. As the New York Post of 13th October 1978 had it: Sid Vicious, bass guitarist of Britains spitting and stomping Sex Pistols Punk Rock band, yesterday was arrested and charged with stabbing his sultry blond girlfriend to death in their room at Manhattans famed Chelsea Hotel. His face pale and scratched, the dazed-looking Vicious muttered curses and ""Ill smash your cameras"" as he was led from the hotel. In court, Sid rests his head on a table and shudders throughout the 10-minute hearing. He is taken to the tough Rikers Island prison, photographed for ID, and locked in a cell to await his trial. And begin detoxification. What happened in the hours that preceded his arrest? Did Sid really kill Nancy? And, if he didnt, who did? The official story goes like this. Sid and Nancy spent the night doing drugs with friends. When they were alone, they fought. Sid took one of his knives and stabbed Nancy in the abdomen then passed out as she bled to death. When the police arrived, Sid confessed. Alan Parkers first witness is Steve Dior, Sids former band mate. Sid might have ""confessed"" when he was slapped conscious by the NYPD but from that day to the day he died, Sid swore he hadnt killed Nancy. Dior remembers Sids insistence when he asked him point blank if hed done it: ""I didnt do it! I didnt kill her! I didnt kill Nancy!"" Its a view shared by other friends of Sid. If they knew one thing about Sid Vicious, it was that he loved Nancy Spungen. But their drug-fuelled life together had been violent. So he loved her, but did that prove he didnt kill her? An autopsy on Nancys body confirmed that she had died from a single stab wound to the abdomen. Shed been stabbed some time between 6am and 7am and died some time between 9am and 10am. The doctors reports of the time said she would have survived between two and three hours after being stabbed. But the police team investigating Nancys murder had overlooked some important evidence: a bottle of Tuinol tablets and some brown flaky powder and three hypodermic needles. They were discovered hours later. Expert opinion insists that the dose of Tuinol that Sid took would have knocked him out cold. Doctors at the time estimated hed been unconscious for five hours or more. Sid came round sometime around 9.30am when he found the body and raised the alarm. According to the experts, he must have been unconscious since, at the latest, 4.30am. If Nancy was stabbed between 6am and 7am, then Sid couldnt have done it. One of the witnesses to the circumstances around Nancys demise was Neon Leon Webster, a singer/songwriter and drug addict who was in room 119 with his girlfriend when Sid and Nancy were said to have visited them at 9.45pm the night before Nancy turned up dead. The version of events Neon Leon gave to the police not only does not stack up but is different to the version of events he gave to the New York Post twelve hours later, which is different again to the version he told the Soho Weekly News a few days after the murder! So with the police case founded on unreliable testimony and experts prepared to say Sid couldnt physically have done it, who did kill Nancy - and why? To take Deep Throats advice to Watergate investigators Woodward and Bernstein - follow the money. Sid and Nancy, not the sort to have bank accounts, had just been paid $20,000 in cash by Virgin Records for the royalties due to Sid for My Way. They hadnt made much of a dent in it yet, so on the night of Nancys murder, most of the cash was sitting in the bedside cabinet in their hotel room. Friends and witnesses who were there in the hours before Nancys body was found remember seeing it. By morning, it was gone. So whoever did kill Nancy had quite a motive... Alan Parkers investigations over the past 22 years have led him to the door of a number of suspects and plenty of evidence that it is likely that Sid did not kill Nancy. Stanley Bard, the Chelsea Hotel manager, bears them out too. And James Merberg, the lawyer hired by McLaren and Virgin Records, to defend Sid believes that if he had made it to trial, Sid would have been acquitted. So that was that. Only Sid is in Rikers Island prison and the police and press think theyve got their man. Case closed. McLaren posts the $25,000 bail. Sid is released into the care of his mother, Anne, and books into The Deauville, a low-rent welfare hostel on Madison Avenue. Sids upbeat, telling McLaren and his mother how his fellow inmates at Rikers loved the Sex Pistols. He was ""Big Charlie Potatoes"" in there. McLaren plans a change of image - clean living, keep fit. But Anne has trouble selling it to her punk legend son. A month later, Sid gives his last UK television interview to Bernard Clarke on BBCs Nationwide. ""Where would you like to be?"" Clarke asks Sid. ""Under the ground."" ""Are you serious?"" ""Oh yeah."" Sid is hanging out with friends - among them Peter Kodick, Steve Dior and Eileen Polk. Theres a new girl too - Michelle Robinson, Sids going to clubs, drinking and popping pills. One night in a Manhattan disco called Hurrahs, he gets into a row with a man called Todd Smith, who takes exception to Sid trying to chat up his girlfriend. Theres a fight. Theres the sound of smashing glass. Peter grabs Sid and makes a human chain behind him. They get out before the police arrive. But Sid finds himself straight back in Rikers. There, he composes poetry about Nancy and mails them to her mother. Those letters from prison changed Deborah Spungens opinion of Sid Vicious. Elsewhere the tide was turning too. Merberg was building a strong defence. McLaren was on his way back to America, ready to look out for Sid on his expected release on bail, with an album deal under one arm. But events took over. Sids released from prison before McLaren can get there - and handed like a parcel to his mother, Anne. They arrive at 63 Bank Street: Michelles flat. Eileen Polk is there. Howie Pyro and Jerry Only, friends of Sids show up. They sit on the bed and listen to Sids tales from Rikers. Then Jerry Nolan and his girlfriend arrive. Sid and Jerry start pestering Anne for money for drugs. Dinner is cooking. Sid plays air guitar to the New York Dolls. They eat. But then Peter Kodick and a friend turn up just before midnight. People start wandering around the flat looking for spoons. Its not long before the guests are once again around Sids bed but this time hes overdosing. They walk him round the flat, fret about whether to call an ambulance. They dont. With Sid just about ok, the guests leave Anne, Sid and Michelle in the flat with a warning to keep Sid away from the rest of the heroin. By morning, Sid Vicious is face down and naked on his bed. At 21 years old. He is dead. NYPD records show that the heroin seized on the streets on New York that winter was cut down to between 32% and 36% pure. But Peter Kodick remembers that the wrap hed bought for Sid that night was nearly 100% pure. The Rolling Stones were in town and Keith Richards didnt entertain anything that wasnt pure or practically uncut. Sergeant Richard Houseman, the first officer on the scene, recalls seeing two women in the flat. The younger - Michelle Robinson - was hysterical, the older - Anne Beverley - eerily calm. On February 7th 1979, Simon John Beverley that became John Simon Ritchie that was Sid Vicious was cremated after a low-key service in New Jersey. That same day, Anne Beverley, pulls up at the guarded gates of St Davids cemetery in Philadelphia carrying her sons ashes. She cant get past the walls and the security. It starts to snow as she walks back to the car. But Anne hasnt left. She is driven to the back of the cemetery, climbs the wall and scatters the ashes on Nancys grave. It is at this graveside in St Davids Jewish Cemetery on the outskirts of Philadelphia, where Nancy Spungen - her hair dyed back to its natural chestnut brown, in her green high-school prom dress - was laid to rest aged 20 by her mother and where the 21-year-old Sid Vicious ashes were scattered by his own mother. And it is here where Alan Parkers story comes to an end. Before she took a fatal pills overdose in 1996, Anne Beverley wrote to Alan Parker. In her letter, she asked him to prove that her son was innocent. 30 years later Who Killed Nancy pulls together all of the evidence on the story of Sid and Nancy. --© Official Site",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest",Alan G.

This adventure epic from co-directors Joachim Roenning and Espen Sandberg (Bandidas) represents the first mainstream effort to dramatize Manus efforts in feature form with elaborate re-creations of his heroic exploits. The bulk of the action spans April 9, 1940 through May 8, 1945, or the period of Nazi Germanys Norwegian occupation. Despite an almost complete lack of formal education, Max (Aksel Hennie) grows completely outraged when Norway falls to Germany and permits the presence of an occupying puppet government within two months. In response, Manus bands together with some other indignant Norwegians and promptly forms a resistance outfit known as the ""Rognes Organization"" -- a group dedicated to collecting weapons, disseminating anti-Nazi propaganda, and exuding a fighting spirit. Later, when Manus is captured by the Germans, he makes not one but two astonishing escapes from the clutches of the Nazis, with his life intact -- demonstrating, hands-down, that he has no fear. Following a period of saboteur training in Scotland, Manus -- incredibly -- slips right back into Norway, and commandeers a mission to sink Nazi supply ships in an Oslo harbor nighttime raid; though successful, it draws nasty acts of vengeance from a psychopathic Gestapo leader Sigfried Fehmer (Ken Duken) -- an event that turns Sigfried and Max into arch enemies with the bitterest hatred for one another. Manus heroic efforts for the liberation of Norway continue undaunted, however.

By day, Souichi remains the ineffectual and timid young man well-liked by everyone; by night, hes a crass, loud, frightening monster named Johannes Klauser II who earns his paycheck screaming rants onstage about rape and murder, to the delight of thousands of shrieking goth metal fans, some of whom actually believe he is a demon incarnate.

The story is ostensibly about the real life events of Chiang Bi-yu (Annie Shizuka Inoh), who ventures to China with her new husband, Chung Hao-tung (Lim Giong), to join the anti-Japanese resistance along with three other friends. Once in China, they are immediately suspected of being Japanese spies and are almost executed. While working with the resistance, Chiang is forced to give up her first-born child -- the call of the motherland had no time for motherhood. When the war ends, they return to Taiwan. Chung takes a job as the principal of a school in the south of the island and starts a Marxist journal called the Enlightenment. As the Red Army swept down the Korean peninsula, Chiang Kai-shek -- at the behest of the Americans -- instituted the White Terror, which rooted out communists of every color. Soon Chung and Chiang are rounded up and brutally interrogated. Chiang is eventually released to her small brood of children while Chung is thrown against the wall and shot.

The only complaints came from local factories whose employees stayed up late to watch and were too tired to work the next day. From then on, Berlusconis empire grew and his shows became evermore heavily populated with half-naked women known as veline, young starlets charged with posing and dancing sexy and silent next to the host.How can one explain the devolution of the politics and media culture of Italy in the age of its current prime minister and media emperor Silvio Berlusconi? As the owner of Mediaset, he controls the majority of the countrys private television stations, and other media outlets such as, for example, Medusa, the countrys largest motion picture producer. As Italys political leader, he maintains considerable control of the state-run RAI channels, affording him an unprecedented hybrid of executive power and private interest to control the airwaves - and to numb the minds of the populace and unapologetically shape public opinion to his financial and political benefit. Cut to August of 2009 when, as reported by the Associated Press, the powers that be at RAI and Mediaset channels refused to broadcast the trailer of the a small independent film called VIDEOCRACY (just prior to its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival) calling the spots ""offensive to the honor and personal reputation of the prime minister."" The film dared to probe the methods and lives of key players in Berlusconis empire, examining how they thrive in the secret leveraging of their own conflicted interests in the realms of fame, politics and finance. Understanding that words simply cannot do his story justice, director Erik Gandini richly illustrates VIDEOCRACY with the trashy TV clips, bucolic political spots and brazen press conferences that swept Berlusconi into power - and the pandering that outshines the crassest of American broadcasters by far. Approaching the material as both insider and outsider, Gandini gains remarkable access to the opulent world of Berlusconis associates and the armies of willing wannabes that swarm around them. Subjects range from Silvio himself, to talent agent Lele Mora, to the infamous paparazzo Fabrizio Corona (currently imprisoned for extortion), to a factory worker seeking the fame that only television can supply. In an environment where any journalist inclined to criticism faces temptation to join the party, Gandini maintains a critical distance and unravels for the viewer a modern Italy as both comedy and tragedy. -- (C) Lorber",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest, Television",Erik Gandini,Lorber Films,84 minutes,"Erik Gandini, Lele Mora, Marella Giovannelli"

1036,14261,Giant,"Giant earns its imposing name with a towering narrative supported by striking cinematography, big ideas, and powerful work from a trio of legendary Hollywood leads.",95%,42,87%,24236,"George Stevens sprawling adaptation of Edna Ferbers best-selling novel successfully walks a fine line between potboiler and serious drama for its 210-minute running time, making it one of the few epics of its era that continues to hold up as engrossing entertainment across the decades. Giant opens circa 1922 in Maryland, where Texas rancher Jordan ""Bick"" Benedict (Rock Hudson) has arrived to buy a stallion called War Winds from its owner, Dr. Horace Lynnton (Paul Fix). But much as Bick loves and knows horses, he finds himself even more transfixed by the doctors daughter, Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), and after some awkward moments, she has to admit that shes equally drawn to the shy, laconic Texan. They get married and Leslie spends her honeymoon traveling with Jordan to his ranch, Reata, which covers nearly a million acres of Texas. Once there, however, she finds that she has to push her way into her rightful role as mistress of the house, past Bicks sister, Luz (Mercedes McCambridge), who cant accept her brothers marriage or the changes it means in the home they share. Also working around Reata is the laconic ranch hand Jett Rink (James Dean) -- from a family as rooted in Texas as the Benedicts but not nearly as lucky (or ""foxy""), Jett is dirt-poor and barely educated at all, and he fairly oozes resentment at Bick for his arrogance, although Luz likes him and for that reason alone Bick is obliged to keep him on. One thing Jett does have in common with his employer is that he is in awe of Leslies beauty; another is his nearly total contempt for the Mexican-Americans who work for them -- Jett and Bick may have contempt for each other, but either one is just as likely to dismiss the Mexican-Americans around them as a bunch of shiftless ""wetbacks."" Luz feels so threatened with a loss of power and control that she decides to assert herself with War Winds, yet another ""prize"" that Bick brought back from Maryland that resists her authority -- then decides to ride the stallion despite being warned that no one but Leslie is wholly safe on him, and spurs him brutally in an effort to break him, which ends up destroying them both in the battle of wills she starts. After Luzs death, Jett learns that she left him a tiny piece of land for his own, on Reata, which he refuses to sell back to Bick, preferring to keep it for his own and maybe prospect for oil on it. Meanwhile, Leslie and Bick have their own problems -- Leslie cant abide the wretched conditions in which the Mexican families who work on Reata are allowed to live, taking a special interest in Mr. and Mrs. Obregon and their baby, Angel; but Bick doesnt want his wife, or any member of his family, concerning themselves with ""those people."" Leslies humanity and her independence push their marriage to the limit, but Bick comes to accept this in his wife, and in four years of marriage they have three handsome children, a boy and two girls, and a loving if occasionally awkward home life. Meanwhile, Jett strikes oil on his land -- which hes named Little Reata -- and in a couple of years hes on his way to becoming the richest man in Texas, getting drilling contracts on all of the land in the area (except Reata) and making more money than the Benedicts ever saw from raising cattle. Bick is almost oblivious to the way Jett grows in power and influence across the years and the state, mostly because hes got his own family to worry about, including a son, Jordan III (Dennis Hopper), who doesnt want to take over the ranch from him, but wants instead to be a doctor; an older daughter, Judy (Fran Bennett), who wants to study animal husbandry and marry a local rancher (Earl Holliman) and start a tiny spread of her own; and a younger daughter, Luz (Carroll Baker), whos just a bit man-crazy and star-struck by the movies.The American entry into the Second World War and the resulting need for oil forces Bick to go into business with Jett and allow him to drill on Reata, and suddenly the Benedicts are wealthy enough to be part of Jett Rinks circle, which includes the governor of the state and at least one United States senator at his beck and call -- and Luz develops a serious crush on Jett, who likes his women young and is especially attracted to her, as Bicks and Leslies daughter. Young Jordan marries Juana, a Mexican-American nursing student (Elsa Cardenas), and his father accepts it begrudgingly, with help from Leslie. The war kills Angel Obregon (Sal Mineo), a death that even affects Bick, but the Benedict family gets through it wealthier than ever and grows some more with the birth of Jordan IV to Jordie and Juana. When the family attends a gala opening of Jett Rink Airport, which concludes with a dinner honoring Jetts success, however, young Jordans wife is humiliated by Jetts racist edicts, and he is beaten up by Jetts men after punching the oil baron. Seeing this, Bick challenges his old rival to the fight thats been brewing for a quarter of a century and wins by default, Jett being too drunk to defend himself or to hit; hes also too drunk to make the grand speech that was to climax the celebration, and he ends up alone in the ballroom. The Benedicts have it out with each other, young Jordan accusing his father of being as much a racist as Jett, and Leslie caught in the middle between her husband and her son. It looks like the Benedicts may lose each other, until an encounter with a racist diner owner forces Bick to stand up and get knocked down (more than once) defending his daughter-in-law and his grandson. Seen today, Giant seems the least dated of any of James Deans three starring films, in part because it addresses issues that remain relevant more than 50 years later, and also because it has the best all-around acting and the best script of any of the three. Taken in broader terms, its even better, with two of the best performances that Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson ever gave, and perhaps the second best of Hudsons whole career (after Seconds) -- the only unfortunate element at modern theatrical screenings is the tendency of younger viewers, who only know him in terms of the revelations late in his life of his being gay, to laugh and snicker at elements of Hudsons characterization; but his work is so good that the titters usually fade after the first 30 minutes or so. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi",G,"Classics, Drama, Western, Romance",George Stevens,Warner Bros.

One can readily see the chemistry between the two stars at work, which would lead to their impending marriage at the time of Harlows death a year later. The sets for the Broadway number that Harlows Mona Leslie performs in are also extraordinary. Mona Leslie (Jean Harlow) is an up-and-coming Broadway actress, dancer, and singer, who leads a happy-go-lucky, freewheeling lifestyle; bailed out of jail by family friend Ned Riley (William Powell), a sports promoter who loves Mona but wont slow down his lifestyle long enough to give her the satisfaction of admitting it, she performs in a bizarre ""benefit"" show, only to discover that she has an audience of one, wealthy admirer Bob Harrison (Franchot Tone). He declares his love for her and a romance does develop, but when he proposes marriage, he discovers that his upper-crust set wont accept a showgirl as one of their blue-blood crowd. Their romance leads to a marriage and desperate unhappiness for all concerned, most of all Harrison, whose basic neurotic nature gets worse as the marriage deteriorates. When Harrison takes his own life, Riley and Mona find themselves accused of every foul deed possible, and when Mona gives birth to a son, a legal battle ensues over custody of the child, with Harrisons family claiming that she is unfit. Finally, Mona decides to fight back -- she gets Harrisons family to stand down by giving up any claim to her late husbands money, but she must now contend with the nations self-appointed moral guardians. No producer will take the risk of backing a show with Mona in it, but she finally gets a helping hand from Ned Riley. The movie has a few too many changes in tone, which detracts from the verisimilitude. The whole story is a film à clef based on the tragic romance between torch singer Libby Holman and tobacco heir Smith Reynolds (which also provided fodder for such à clef films as Brief Moment, Sing, Sinner, Sing, and Written on the Wind) -- and Harlows singing is obviously dubbed, just as her dancing is doubled. Also, the songs -- except for the final two numbers -- dont quite fit with the melodrama, and the Damon Runyon-esque comic antics feel completely out of left field at times.

When he is unavoidably delayed, he sends his friend Tareq (Alexander Siddig), who had been his security officer for many years, to escort her throughout the beautiful and exotic city. The last thing anyone expects is that they will fall in love. Cairo Time is a love letter to a city intertwined with a love story about a woman. It began when Syrian-Canadian writer/director Ruba Nadda first visited Cairo with her family many years ago. Returning a decade ago with one of her sisters, (and no longer under the protective eye of her father) they had memorable adventures. ""The city was beautiful and the people were beautiful,"" Nadda recalled. Having lived in Damascus, and subsequently traveled the world, Nadda never forgot the grandeur and the chaos of this ancient city that was originally settled in Paleolithic times. Sitting at the border of what was once Upper and Lower Egypt, the area that was to become the metropolis of Cairo has played host to the Greeks, Romans, Crusaders, the Ottomans, Napoleon, and the British and is now one of the most densely populated cities in the world. ""I remember the city being alive. Its gritty and historical and seething with humanity and I just had to capture it on screen."" Truly, a journey through Cairo is a journey through time and it awakens your soul. It was during Naddas many trips to international film festivals with her 14 short films and her previous feature, Sabah, that she came to appreciate the feelings of introspection and melancholy that traveling alone engenders. From these experiences came Cairo Time, something Nadda deems a ""real love story, but one that is very un-West because to me the West is about acquiring, accomplishing, deadlines and running, running, running. The central character, Juliette, is suddenly forced to slow down and move on Cairo time."" This film has a West-meets-East quality to the unexpected, unrequited love between an Arab man and a North American woman. Its also a throw to old style, classic films reminiscent of the restrained, emotional tension in the work of Jane Austen. Juliette is a woman who married young and still ardently loves her husband, Mark, who works abroad. Their children have grown up and moved away. Life, doing what it usually does to a marriage, has replaced their hopes and dreams with accomplishment and responsibilities. In the back of her head, Juliette had thought that sooner or later, she and her husband would have time for each other, which was the reason for her trip to Cairo. ""I love this woman,"" explained Nadda. ""She is quiet. And she has a sadness thats just under the surface which comes from a lifetime of being by herself a lot because shes been stood up by a husband whose work has often taken priority."" Unable to meet Juliette when she lands, but knowing that she is an independent woman who is likely to head off on her own, Mark asks Tareq to care for her. For years, Mark had trusted Tareq with his own life, so it made sense to extend that trust to Juliettes wellbeing. Once at the hotel, Juliette is alone again. Unwilling to wait quietly for her husbands arrival, every effort she makes to venture out on her own is rebuffed. Cairo is not a gentle city. With a population of 17 million, the noise is unbearable. The heat, mixed with dust, is oppressive. Traffic does not adhere to lanes or stop lights. And women, particularly foreigners, do not easily move about in public alone. Quickly, Juliette learns that the simple activities of everyday living in Canada, like walking across the street, become a test of wills in Cairo. And so she turns to Tareq who shows her first, Cairo, and then herself. -- (C) Official Site",PG (for mild thematic elements and smoking),"Art House & International, Drama, Romance",Ruba Nadda,IFC Films,88 minutes,"Patricia Clarkson, Alexander Siddig, Elena Anaya"

But for every triumph, Maradona suffered his fair share of setbacks -including a fifteen month suspension after testing positive for cocaine in 1991, and yet another for testing positive for ephedrine during the 1994 World Cup. An outspoken athlete whose own inability to censor himself often resulted in the most controversy, Maradona nevertheless endured to become one of the most outstanding athletes in the history of the game. Named for the illegal goal-scoring move he used to defeat England during the 1986 World Cup quarter-final match, Maradona, Hand of God explores the life and career of this polarizing figure from a perspective that reserves judgment, and allows the actions of the athlete to speak for themselves. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Drama, Sports & Fitness",Marco Risi,nothing,nothing,"Marco Leonardi, Julieta Díaz, Juan Leyrado"

After several ""minor"" killings (adroitly and subtly conveyed by director Lerner), Claude is assigned the task of murdering mob witness Billie Williams (Caprice Toriel). Despite his qualms about killing a woman-not because hes got a sentimental streak, but because women are ""difficult"" to kill without a lot of extra preparation-he accepts the job. His first two attempts come to naught, due to circumstances beyond his control. While laying the groundwork for his third try, Claude finds out that his two trusted associates (Herschel Bernardi and Phillip Pine) have been ordered to kill him because of his earlier failures.

Lluís Homar stars as the former Mateo Blanco, a screenwriter and ex-director who changed his name to Harry Caine after losing his sight in an automobile accident. A past scandal suddenly resurfaces when the news arrives that the producer of one of Harrys old movies (""Girls and Suitcases""), a corrupt stockbroker named Ernesto Martel (José Luis Gómez), has died. For mysterious reasons, this makes Harrys ex-production manager Judit (Blanca Portillo) nervous; then Ernestos son, Ray X (Rubén Ochandiano), turns up and asks Harry to help him write a vindictive script to get back at his vile father. The film subsequently flashes back to the early 90s, when Martel became involved with his secretary, Lena (Cruz), but Mateo also began to develop feelings for her, and auditioned her for ""Girls and Suitcases."" In response to Mateos interest in Lena (and her burgeoning interest in him), the jealous Martel commissioned Ray to make a documentary about the making of ""Girls and Suitcases"" as an excuse to spy on the director and star. This enabled him to watch Mateo spiriting off with Lena right under his nose, and set the stage for the wily producers elaborate revenge against Mateo.

The totalitarian governments power was derived in no small part from their ability to censor cultural life and keep Western culture on the other side of the border. Rock and Roll was but a rumor and the only television shows on the air were dreary propaganda. But one day everything changed. Just a few miles across the border in Finland, a huge new television antenna was built that broadcast western signals in all directions--including directly into the heart of the Talinn, the capital of Estonia. Filmmakers Jaak Kilmi and Kiur Aarma grew up in Talinn in the 80s, and in DISCO AND ATOMIC WAR they make use of wonderfully playful but credible recreations to set their true personal coming of age story against the backdrop of the rapid collapse of the Soviet government in Estonia. As illicit television antennas sprung up in Northern Estonia, rumors about the attempted murder of J.R. Ewing spread by word of mouth to the rural south, and the nation of Estonia was as gripped by the saga as the USA had ever been. Teenagers went to their school dances and imitated the disco moves they saw on television, clothing and hairstyles began to change radically, and things would never be the same. The government controlled media scrambled to create western-style soap operas and disco-saturated television programming that vaguely reinforced communist values, but it was far too little, and much too late. The genie was out of the bottle, Estonians were now in the grip of American television, and they began to dream that one day, they too would spend their days working in skyscrapers and their nights drinking fine whiskey by the pool, alongside their robot car.

In the summer of 1914, Adrien Fournier (Eric Caravaca) is an engineer conscripted into the French Army, where he is made a lieutenant and assigned to join a group of soldiers helping to design and build a bridge to move troops near the front lines. While scouting a suitable location for the bridge, Fournier and his fellows are caught in the middle of an attack, and a shell explodes in his face.

It is some time before Fournier can be moved to an Army hospital, and he cannot talk through his ruined mouth, communicating with notes scratched onto a small chalkboard. Fournier finds himself in a special hospital wing for officers whove suffered severe injuries (a relatively comfortable area a good bit different from the crowded and spartan wards for common foot soldiers), and as a dedicated surgeon (Andre Dussollier) struggles to rebuild Fourniers face with the primitive means available to him, the once-handsome engineer ponders an uncertain future. Commiserating with Fournier are Alain (Jean-Michel Portal), his best friend from college; Pierre (Gregori Derangere) and Henri (Denis Podalydes), a pair of fellow officers also suffering facial injuries; and Anais (Sabine Azema), a patient and warm-hearted nurse who brings hope to the hospitals most severely injured men.

Tyrone Power heads the cast as American news correspondent Jake Barnes, who, after incurring a injury in WW I that has rendered him impotent, relocates to Paris to escape his troubles. Barnes links up with several other lost souls, including the nymphomaniacal Lady Brett Ashley (Ava Gardner), irresponsible drunkard Mike Campbell (Errol Flynn) and perennial hangers-on Robert Cohn (Mel Ferrer) and Bill Gorton (Eddie Albert). In their never-ending search for new thrills, Barnes and his cohorts trundle off to Spain, where they participate in the annual Pamplona bull run and act as unofficial ""sponsors"" of handsome young matador Pedro Romero (played by future film executive Robert Evans). Additionally, Lady Brett pursues a romance with Jake, despite her engagement to the dissolute Campbell. Filmed on location in Pamplona, Paris, Biarritz and Mexico, The Sun Also Rises was budgeted at $5 million; like many ""big"" pictures of the era, it tended to be hollow and draggy at times. The films best performance is delivered by Errol Flynn, though it can be argued that, in taking on the role of the hedonistic, hard-drinking, burned-out Mike Campbell, he was merely playing himself.

In the early hours of a cool San Francisco morning in 2007, a line of people beginning at the Moscone Conference Center stretches for an incredible ten blocks. This is the site of the 27th annual Macworld expo and conference. It was in this very same building 24 years prior that Apple unveiled their revolutionary personal computer, the Macintosh. At the time, the general public hadnt yet adapted to the idea of having a home computer, but the Macintosh soon changed all of that. Soon after the first Mac user group was formed at the University of California at Berkeley, MUGs began popping up all across the world. As a result, a global community of Mac users was formed. Then in the 90s, Microsoft appeared poised to put Apple out of business. Things began to look up when Steve Jobs unveiled the first iMac in 1997, though it wasnt until the introduction of the iPod four years later that the companys comeback was truly cemented. A decade later, however, the arrival of the iPhone led some longtime Mac supporters to suspect that their community was beginning to unravel as Apple went mainstream.

White (Harry Carey Sr.), is a pilot stationed at Clark Field in the Philippines. Then more characters make entrances: the aircraft commander Quincannon (John Ridgely); Weinberg (George Tobias), a Jewish mechanic from New York; and a man from a farm in the upper Midwest -- they all represent a broad cross-section of America as it saw itself, and the ""regular guys"" in the Army Air Force as it existed in 1941. The flight proceeds without incident. Winocki, an embittered, washed-out flight school candidate who accidentally killed another pilot, is about to leave the service when the weather report from Hickam Field is interrupted, and the radio man begins picking up transmissions in Japanese. The Mary Ann and the rest of the squadron fly right into the middle of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor unarmed and out of gas, and nearly crack up landing on an emergency field; no sooner do they make repairs than the crew comes under attack, and the plane takes off and makes for Hickam Field, which they find a flaming shambles. They fly on to the Philippines, stopping at Wake Island just long enough to meet a few members of the doomed Marine garrison, taking their company mascot, a dog, with them. At Clark Field, the Mary Ann and her crew finally go into action against the enemy, flying in alone against a Japanese invasion force; Quincannon is mortally wounded in the brief action, which leaves the plane damaged seemingly beyond repair. The remaining crew wont give up the plane, however, even when ordered to abandon and destroy her; they get the bomber off just ahead of the advancing Japanese, and survive to help bring retribution to the invading fleet and the Japanese empire. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi",NR,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama",Howard Hawks,WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES,124 minutes,"John Garfield, Gig Young, Arthur Kennedy"

Jackie Chan stars as Bob Ho, an international spy on loan to the CIA who gives up his job in hopes of leading a so-called normal life with his next-door-neighbor girlfriend and her rambunctious brood. Theres nothing in Spy that the audience hasnt seen before from similarly themed incarnations (think The Pacifier), but, fans will appreciate director Brian Levants homage to Jackie Chans past Hong Kong movie blockbusters -- most notably, Police Story and The Legend of Drunken Master -- during the opening credit sequence, which is fitting considering many of the action sequences are derivative of those films.The main story centers on Bobs relationship with artsy single mom Gillian (Amber Valletta) and her three kids: precocious teenage stepdaughter Farren (Madeline Carroll), nerdy middle child Ian (Will Shadley), and adorably energetic Nora (Alina Foley). After an emergency sends Gillian away to Denver, Bob steps up and offers to watch the kids while shes gone. Ill-equipped to handle a situation thats clearly over his head, Bob utilizes his spy skills and gadgets -- video watch, GPS tracking, x-ray glasses -- to gain control over the situation in hopes of winning over the kids affection, but when an old enemy escapes from prison and threatens his potential family, Bob must return to his 007 world of international espionage to protect them.Admittedly, theres a certain level of cheese in this film, especially when it comes to the Boris-and-Natasha-style villains, Poldark (Magnús Scheving) and Creel (Katherine Boecher), whose silly Russian stereotyped performances and running joke about American fashion unabashedly border on cringe-worthy territory. Not to mention, the thinly plotted storyline involving brainiac Ian, who accidentally downloads a top-secret formula for oil-eating ooze created by the bad guys, which propels the main action of the film. Adding to the pile are the supporting cast members: George Lopez as the traitorous CIA agent, Glaze, and Billy Ray Cyrus as CIA agent and Bobs BFF Colton James, who lends folksy witticisms like ""As gone as rum cake at an AA meeting.""Even so, Chans charm wins out in the end, and The Spy Next Doors most effective sequences involve Bobs attempts to bond with the kids -- from taking little Nora shopping for a Halloween costume to helping Ian with school bullies and girls. These comedic moments more or less overshadow an otherwise simplistic narrative, and the audience cant help but smile to themselves every time Chan appears onscreen. Die-hard fans might miss the era of classic kick-ass Hong Kong action films, but Spy manages to fill that void as an entertaining alternative that kids and parents alike will enjoy. ~ Alaina OConnor, Rovi",PG (for sequences of action violence and some mild rude humor),"Action & Adventure, Comedy",Brian Levant,Lionsgate,94 minutes,"Jackie Chan, Amber Valletta, Madeline Carroll"

The manager of Englands national football unexpectedly succumbs to a heart attack, and suddenly the search is on for a replacement. Most people who seem qualified for the position have the good sense to turn it down, and so the responsibility falls to Mike Bassett (Ricky Tomlinson), a scruffy and loud-mouthed lout whose claim to football fame is leading a previously undistinguished team to a league championship. Bassett insists that England will win the World Cup under his leadership, but thats before he replaces his star player with a once-gifted footballer (Dean Lennox Kelly) who has since developed a drinking problem, and hired a one-time car salesman (Philip Jackson) as his assistant. After several stunning losses to Poland, Bassett goes from a favorite of both fans and the press to one of the most hated men in England; hoping to whip his team into shape, he subjects them to the high-tech training methods of eccentric Dr. Shoegaarten (Ulrich Thomsen), which injures more players than it helps. Despite Bassetts ineptitude, England manages to qualify for the World Cup tournament thanks to a loophole in the rules, and he flies to Rio with his team in hopes of somehow turning their bad luck around. British television journalist Martin Bashir, musician and comic Keith Allen, and international football sensation Pele all appear as themselves to lend Mike Bassett: England Manager an air of authenticity. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",NR,Comedy,Steve Barron,nothing,nothing,"Ricky Tomlinson, Amanda Redman, Philip Jackson"

Romero returns to Night of the Living Dead turf with middling success in this quirky end-of-civilization thriller, also released as The Crazies. The paranoid scenario involves a government-engineered killer virus (identified by the title moniker) which is accidentally released into the water supply of Evans, Pennsylvania, driving most of the inhabitants stark-raving mad and forcing the declaration of martial law as the entire town is placed under quarantine. This does not sit well with the locals -- even those who have not yet been contaminated who consider the military mobilization tantamount to war. Romero keeps the momentum up by causing an escalating series of disasters, with each attempt at resolution making the horrors exponentially worse. One might be led to consider this a metaphor for Vietnam -- the militarys presence is depicted as more threatening than the killers theyve been sent to subdue -- but the film as a whole is too wildly erratic to focus on allegory, generating instead a ham-fisted criticism of government power. Pontificating aside, this is an effective, fast-paced thriller, thanks to some very effective setpieces, steadily mounting tension and outbursts of jarring violence.",R,"Action & Adventure, Horror, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy",George A.

Back in the early 1970s, at a mental institution near the Russian border, a crazed doctor violated the Hippocratic Oath in the most repulsive manner imaginable.

Thirty years later, an American film crew has arrived at the hospital to shoot a horror film based on those awful events. The director, Steven, is determined to make the film as realistic as possible, a goal that doesnt seem too far-fetched when his Finnish sound men discover a hidden room in the hospital basement. There, perfectly preserved, are the original snuff films shot by ""the Auteur"" three decades prior. Its the perfect fodder for the must brutal horror film ever made, and Steven quickly sets about rewriting his script to make it as raw as possible.

At that time, a handful of Disney executives were questioning the wisdom of continuing to make animated films, as the company was making more money in live-action movies, theme parks, and television. That changed when Roy Disney -- Walts nephew and the last figure from the studios Golden Age management team still on board -- teamed up with newly hired studio executives Michael D. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg to restore their reputation for both quality and commercial appeal. With the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, the team sparked a new interest in animation on the big screen, and a string of smash hits that began with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast launched a new era of both acclaim and box-office success for the company.

Panda! Go Panda! tells a simple story aimed at young children, but the oddness of the premise also keeps it interesting for older fans of Miyazakis work. The plot revolves around Mimiko, an orphaned little girl living on her own, who discovers a pair of talking pandas. She takes in the father and his baby son, and together they form a surrogate family. What follows is cute, innocent fun as Mimiko and the pandas get into various comical mishaps, but there is some noteworthy subtext for adult viewers, as well. The ""papa"" panda can alternately be seen as a proxy father, a husband figure, or even a child for Mimiko, and the cheerfulness with which she deals with being parentless is both inspiring and unsettling. Still, this is first and foremost a bright, cheerful tale that will please the young -- and young at heart -- with its wholesome action and humorous situations. From these modest beginnings, Miyazaki went on to create such masterpieces as My Neighbor Totoro, Kikis Delivery Service, and Spirited Away, while Takahata directed the unforgettable Grave of the Fireflies. ~ Skyler Miller, Rovi",G,"Animation, Comedy, Kids & Family",Isao Takahata,TMS Entertainment,35 minutes,"Kazuko Sugiyama, Kazuo Kumakura, Yoshiko Ohta"

The Canteen was established so that Our Boys on leave in Tinseltown could have a good time with good food and good dancing -- and, as a bonus, rub shoulders with their favorite movie personalities, who functioned as waiters, chefs, busboys and dancing partners. Since the 1944 all-star flick Hollywood Canteen was produced by Warner Bros., it was only to be expected that the celebrities seen herein would consist mostly of Warner Bros. contract players. The frail plot concerns a soldier on medical leave (played by Robert Hutton) who falls in love with lovely leading lady Joan Leslie (played by Joan Leslie) while visiting the Canteen. Bette Davis and John Garfield are on hand to emcee the Canteens variety acts, and to act as cupids for the Hutton/Leslie romance. The ""supporting cast"" includes the likes of The Andrews Sisters, Jack Benny, Joe E. Brown, Eddie Cantor, Sidney Greenstreet, Paul Henreid, Peter Lorre, Ida Lupino, Dennis Morgan, Roy Rogers, S.Z. Sakall, Barbara Stanwyck, and the Jimmy Dorsey and Carmen Cavallaro musical aggregations. Virtually everyone involved donated their salaries to the Canteen fund--even Jack Benny. As with most of these patriotic wartime star rallies, the results are a mixed bag: the best sequences include Bennys violin ""duel"" with Joseph Szigeti and Roy Rogers and the Sons of the Pioneers introducing Cole Porters Dont Fence Me In.

But Marcel is home, and Armand stops Knifer from killing him. The grateful man protects Armand when the police show up. Knifer is killed and Marie escapes. Armand, who has been wounded, is nursed back to health by Marcel, and he goes on to lead an honest life. Marie sees Armand kissing another girl and she becomes bent on revenge. Armand goes away on business, and with the financial aid of the Apache leader (Otto Marieson), Marie poses as a convent-bred girl. She wins Marcels love and marries him, only telling him of her plot after the ceremony is completed. Armand returns from London and she rushes to him. The Apaches, believing that they are being double-crossed, take a shot at her. Although she is wounded, she recovers. Marcel goes to America and arranges a divorce so that the two lovers can be together.

The death of Milous mother, the family matriarch, brings the entire clan together for one weekend to settle the estate.

Milou attempts to show his family what can happen if a person lets life lead him instead of always trying to lead ones life.

This complex episodic film parallels the story of a contemporary Joseph (Theirry Rode) and Mary (Myriem Roussel) with that of a science class studying the origins of life on earth. Joseph is a cab driver and Mary plays on a womans basketball team. A thuggish angel (Philippe Lacoste) tells Mary that she is with child. When she tells Joseph that she is pregnant, he accuses Mary of having cheated on him. The professor of the science class (Johan Leysen), who is having an affair with one of his students (Anne Gauthier), presents the theory that life came to earth from somewhere else in the universe. Godard organizes scenes from these two narratives into an essay about the relationship between the spirit and the body, and how being is born from nothingness. The film is filled with images of light cascading over the Swiss countryside. Godard often has his cinematographers Jean-Bernard Menoud and Jacques Firmann shoot directly into the sun and capture ravishing shots of pure luminosity. Hail Mary is introduced by a short film by Godards frequent directing partner Anne-Marie Miéville entitled The Book Of Mary, the story of a young girl named Marie whose parents separate.

Born Domenikos Theotokopoulos on Crete in 1541 and portrayed here by Nick Ashdon, El Greco writes out his story as he sits in prison awaiting execution by the Spanish Inquisition, and the events of his life play out in extended flashbacks. The tale itself begins on the isle of Crete in 1566, when Domenikos falls for sensual Venetian Francesca (Dimitra Matsouka), daughter of the Cretean governor. Domenikoss father, however, attempts to lead a political rebellion on the island, which forces the young painter to be shuttled off to Venice and away from the young lass. Once there, his path intersects not only with the famed artist Titian (Sotiris Moustakas) but Nino de Guevara (Juan Diego Botto), a Spanish priest with not-so-subtle homosexual designs on this new arrival. Ninos actions spiral downward into destructive malevolence, and in time, he turns up as the chief Inquisitor in one of historys bloodiest and most notorious debacles - spurned, roiled by the knowledge that El Greco has taken a female partner, and itching to dole out a fatal reprisal on the painter who never became his lover. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Drama",Yannis Smaragdis,nothing,nothing,"Nick Ashdon, Juan Diego Botto, Laia Marull"

Jon Hall stars as Frank Raymond, grandson of the man who invented the invisibility formula several pictures back. When Nazi agents try to coerce the secret formula out of Raymond, he eludes them by becoming transparent himself. Shortly afterward, the US government parachutes Raymond behind enemy lines, reasoning that an invisible counterespionage agent would be an invaluable tool in defeating the Axis. He is aided and abetted by the beautiful Maria Sorenson (Ilona Massey), who may or may not be in league with villains Helser (J. Edward Bromberg in a scene-stealing turn), Stauffer (Cedric Hardwicke) and Japanese spy Ikito (Peter Lorre). As was always the case in Universals mid-1940s fantasies, David Horsleys special effects work in Invisible Agent is absolutely first-rate, with some truly eye-popping moments.

Unfortunately, the computer spews forth the embodiment of Pure Evil--and by the end of the film, three of the five pranksters lie dead.

1904,15625,Moloch (Molokh),nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"Each film of Alexandre Sokurov, considered by many the living Andrei Tarkovsky of the Russian cinema, is a new revelation. Molochs narrative structure is based on the relationship between one of the most important figures of the twentieth century, Adolf Hitler, and the only person who ever dared to contradict him, his beloved Eva Braun. The year is 1942. On the majestic terraces of the ominous fortress of Berchtesgaden, perched above the Bavarian Alps, a woman prances in the nude, waving randomly at the spying telescopes. This is the restless Eva (Elena Rufanova), who is waiting for her beloved ""Adi,"" the Fuhrer ({Leonid Mosgovoi}), who arrives with a thunder and bolt. In his entourage are his right-hand man Martin Bormann and his propaganda specialist Joseph Goebbels with his loving wife, Magda. The scene is set for a peaceful retreat of several hours. However, an uncontrollable war is raging in the heart of Eva, who is caught in the complexities of a man incapable of intimacy. Rather than a historical treatise, the film is a psychological study of the man who was the terror of the twentieth century and the person who was the closest to him. The clue to how it all happened seems to be hidden in some of the intimate moments between the two characters. Sokurov is dealing with a very sensitive subject in a film which is a complex reflection on power. Each frame carries the mark of his previous nine films and is a testimony to his meticulous art. Moloch is a very powerful film that gives the impression that time is suspended. Particularly for this reason, it is not recommended to those who like their cinema fast paced and light-hearted. Sokurov used Russian theater actors from St. Petersburg to shoot the film, but their voices were later dubbed by theater actors from Berlin. The film received the Best Screenplay award of the 52nd Cannes Film Festival, 1999. ~ Gönül Dönmez-Colin, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Drama",Aleksandr Sokurov,nothing,nothing,"Yelena Rufanova, Leonid Mozgovoy, Leonid Sokol"

In medieval Prague, Rabbi Loew (Albert Steinruck) observes the stars and concludes that trouble is brewing for his people. When the emperor issues a decree threatening the expulsion of Jews from the city, the rabbi, a master of magic, activates the Golem, a monstrous clay figure, to help save his congregation. The rabbis daughter, Miriam (Lyda Salmonova, who also played this role in the 1914 film) is courted by two men, Famulus (Ernst Deutsch), the rabbis assistant, and Knight Florian (Lathar Menthel), a messenger for the emperor. Famulus re-activates the Golem to vanquish his rival, and the monster goes berserk.

Diaz traces the growth of global poverty back to colonization in the 15th century, and features interviews with a number of economists, sociologists, and historians who explain how poverty is the clear consequence of free-market economic policies that allow powerful nations to exploit poorer countries for their assets and keep money in the hands of the wealthy rather than distributing it more equitably to the people who have helped them gain their fortunes. Diaz also explores how wealthy nations (especially the United States) seize a disproportionate share of the worlds natural resources, and how this imbalance is having a dire impact on the environment as well as the economy.

Despite all sorts of temptations, the girl refuses the architects invitation to become his mistress, holding out for marriage or nothing. Meanwhile, middle-aged rake David Niven tries to move in on the girl himself, with an equal lack of success. So why was this harmless little comedy so controversial? It seems that director Otto Preminger decided to film the play as written, retaining such words as ""virgin,"" ""seduce,"" and ""mistress"" in the script. The antediluvian Motion Picture Production Code refused to approve the film so long as those naughty words remained in the dialogue; thus, Preminger released the picture minus the Codes seal of approval. Rather than hurt the films chances at the box office, Premingers bold move resulted in a major financial success -- not to mention the beginning of the end for the ancient, wheezy Production Code. However, in the meantime, troubles piled up; the Jersey City Municipal Court -- at the hands of Secaucus Justice George King -- fined Alfred Manfredonia, manager of the Stanley Theatre, 100 dollars for screening the film (declaring him guilty of violating a city ordinance), and a ban was imposed on the picture by the Maryland State Board of Motion Picture Censors. While The New York Times Bosley Crowther dismissed the accusations of prurience, he blithely observed, ""The Moon Is Blue is not outstanding, either as a romance or as a film...at times, it gets awfully tedious...Its charm...will depend on how much one delights in its choice of words.""",PG,"Classics, Comedy, Romance",Otto Preminger,Warner Bros.

Tillman served a tour of duty in Iraq and was on patrol in Afghanistan when, on April 22, 2004, he was killed during a reconnaissance mission near the border of Pakistan. When word spread about Tillmans death, the Army issued a press release declaring hed been shot down while trying to heroically block the fire of a band of Taliban insurgents. While the Armys story painted a glowing picture of the fallen soldier and athlete, some of the details sounded suspect to Tillmans family, and in time they began asking questions. As it happens, Tillmans parents were outspoken in their opposition to the war in Iraq, and after he had seen what was happening firsthand, so was Tillman, who had been a sharp student with an interest in politics during his college years. In time, Tillmans parents demanded an investigation into their sons death, and the testimony of several witnesses revealed that Tillman wasnt felled during an act of heroism -- his death was the result of ""friendly fire"" by men from his own company, shooting indiscriminately at an unknown target. Filmmaker Amir Bar-Lev examines Pat Tillmans unusual life and times, the facts about his death, how and why the military created a cover story to hide the truth, and his familys battle to bring the real story into the open in the documentary The Tillman Story, which received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.",R (for language),"Documentary, Special Interest",Amir Bar-Lev,The Weinstein Company,95 minutes,"Josh Brolin, Dannie Tillman, Richard Tillman"

Its main concession to Hollywood formula was the casting of star players who were all too old to convincingly portray Hemingways ""Lost Generation"" protagonists. Tyrone Power heads the cast as American news correspondent Jake Barnes, who, after incurring a injury in WW I that has rendered him impotent, relocates to Paris to escape his troubles. Barnes links up with several other lost souls, including the nymphomaniacal Lady Brett Ashley (Ava Gardner), irresponsible drunkard Mike Campbell (Errol Flynn) and perennial hangers-on Robert Cohn (Mel Ferrer) and Bill Gorton (Eddie Albert). In their never-ending search for new thrills, Barnes and his cohorts trundle off to Spain, where they participate in the annual Pamplona bull run and act as unofficial ""sponsors"" of handsome young matador Pedro Romero (played by future film executive Robert Evans). Additionally, Lady Brett pursues a romance with Jake, despite her engagement to the dissolute Campbell. Filmed on location in Pamplona, Paris, Biarritz and Mexico, The Sun Also Rises was budgeted at $5 million; like many ""big"" pictures of the era, it tended to be hollow and draggy at times. The films best performance is delivered by Errol Flynn, though it can be argued that, in taking on the role of the hedonistic, hard-drinking, burned-out Mike Campbell, he was merely playing himself.

In private life, the pastor is given moral support by his loyal wife Catherine Marshall (Jean Peters). At the time of his comparatively early death, Marshall has become chaplain of the US Senate. Interestingly enough, while Marshall and his family are identified by name, the peripheral political characters are given fictional monickers--and sometimes, as in the case of the President played by William Forrest, no names at all. Director Henry Koster expertly avoids filming Marshalls sermons in a static, declamatory fashion. As Catherine Marshall, Jean Peters does wonders with a comparatively limited role; her best scene is her last, when she overcomes her lifelong fear of the ocean for the sake of her son (Billy Chapin).

In True Grit, Wayne plays grumpy, pot-bellied U.S. marshal ""Rooster"" Cogburn, hired by 14-year-old Mattie Ross (Kim Darby) to find Tom Chaney (Jeff Corey), who killed her father. The headstrong Mattie could have had her pick of lawmen, but selects the aging Cogburn because she believes he has ""true grit"" (she talks this way all through the picture, so be prepared). Also heading into Indian territory in search of Chaney is Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Glen Campbell), who wants to collect the reward placed on the fugitives head for his earlier crimes. Complicating matters are Chaneys scurrilous cronies Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall), Quincy (Jeremy Slate), and Moon (Dennis Hopper), who have no qualms about killing a troublesome teenaged girl like Mattie. While the plot of True Grit, adapted (and streamlined) by Marguerite Roberts from the novel by Charles Portis, maintains audience interest throughout, the glue that truly holds this Western together is John Wayne, delivering one of his finest performances (though some believe he was better in She Wore a Yellow Ribbon). Waynes casual charisma is infinitely more effective than the mannered method acting of Kim Darby and the floundering non-acting of poor Glen Campbell. And who could not love the climatic face-off between Duvall and company and John Wayne, whose ""Fill your hand, you son of a bitch!"" is not only a classic bit of dialogue, but the apotheosis of the Wayne mystique.

2075,16448,Cops,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"Although Cops is one of the all-time great two-reelers, its creator, Buster Keaton, never thought much of it. He felt it was just a run-of-the-mill chase film, which suggests that perhaps Keaton was his own worst critic -- the chase is what gives the film its brilliance. The films beginning is a portent of things to come: Keaton longingly looks at his girl Virginia Fox through what appear to be prison bars. In reality, its the gate to the mansion where she lives. The girl sends Keaton away, telling him not to return until he is a success in business. Keaton attempts to do so, acquiring, through convoluted means, a horse, wagon, and a load of stolen furniture. Somehow he drives his wagon into the middle of a policemans parade, where an anarchists bomb falls in his lap. Carelessly, he lights his cigarette with it and throws it away. It explodes in the middle of the parade, and suddenly Keaton is pursued by every cop in the city. The surrealistic vision of Keaton, small and alone, evading these hundreds upon hundreds of policemen is unforgettable. The filmmaker was both athlete and comic, and here he makes maximum use of both talents, racing down streets, playing a balancing act on a ladder, and casually grabbing hold of a car as it flies past, all in an attempt to evade the cops. When it was first released, this comic short confused many people -- its subtle statements (including its blend of humor and politics) went over the head of the average filmgoer of the 20s.

Paterfamilias Roland Young poses as a veteran of the Bengal Lancers in order to insinuate himself into high society; his birdbrained wife Billie Burke willingly goes along with any scheme her husband cooks up; and their work-resistant offspring Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Janet Gaynor scheme to marry into weatlth. Right now, Janets target is Scottish millionaire Richard Carlson (making his screen debut) to fill the familys coffers. The whole family teams up to fleece a wealthy old lady called Miss Fortune,played with showstopping relish by Broadway veteran Minnie Dupree. Through Miss Fortunes sweet, unassuming example, everyone in the family begins to reform. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. makes the supreme sacrifice of taking a job-which has the salutary effect of winning him the affections of poor-but-honest Paulette Goddard. Young in Heart originally ended with Miss Fortune passing away while surrounded by the repentant family; preview audiences hated this denouement, obliging Selznick to film a new ending, with Minnie Dupree joyously tooling about on a motorcyle!

2086,16465,The Outrage,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"Derived from Rashomon, the classic 1951 Japanese film, The Outrage attempts to modernize the original story of rape and murder, transporting from medieval Japan to the American Southwest of the 1870s. The story is told within the framework of three men waiting at a railway station. A con-man (Edward G. Robinson) listens to the account of a trial held recently in the town as told by a prospector (Howard Da Silva) and a preacher (William Shatner) suffering from a crisis of faith in humanity. Three witnesses at the trial of a Mexican outlaw give conflicting testimony. Each version is shown in flashback. The outlaw, Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman), confesses that he bound the husband (Laurence Harvey), raped the wife, and killed the husband in a duel of honor. The wife (Claire Bloom) claims that the outlaw raped her, and then she stabbed her husband when he contemptuously blamed her for inviting the assault. The third witness, an old Indian (Paul Fix), declares that he found the dying husband who stated that he stabbed himself because he couldnt live with the humiliation. At this point, the narrative is interrupted by an abandoned babys cry. The child has gold hidden in his clothing which the con-man attempts to appropriate. Then the discussion of the trial continues, turning brusquely from drama to parody. The prospector admits that he witnessed the rape, but that the wife nagged the two men into fighting over her. The husband tripped and fell on his own knife. The prospector, who stole the jeweled knife from the dead body, chose not to appear in court. Possibly out of some desire for redemption, the prospector decided to care for the abandoned baby, and the preacher regains faith from the supposed altruistic action. The eerily deserted train station and the strong black-and-white cinematography contribute a mild surreal quality to the film, but can do little to save the story from its flaws. The changes in the characters necessary to accommodate the new setting cause them to lose important symbolic significance in the translation. Despite a star cast and strong acting, the new version is mediocre at best. The Outrage falls woefully short of the acclaimed Japanese original.",NR,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Western",Martin Ritt,Warner Home Video,95 minutes,"Paul Newman, Laurence Harvey, Claire Bloom"

The casual and relaxed atmosphere of the film makes viewers feel as if they are eavesdropping on an intimate family evening. Catherine prepares tomato sauce and meatballs while explaining how she learned to cook from her mother and mother-in-law as a young woman. After looking at vacation photos while sitting on the plastic-slip-covered living-room sofa, the family shares dinner together. Much is revealed as son Marty gently guides the conversation with questions revolving around what life was once like for Catherine and Charles and their parents, and contemporary street scenes, archive shots, and family photos are interspersed among the responses. What emerges is a vivid personal view of history, a slice of life as it was lived during the first half of the 20th century in New York and in Italy.

Antonio Zuniga was a street performer and peddler in Mexico who was arrested on charges of murder and convicted largely on the testimony of one man. However, the man was a close relative of the victim who had no firm evidence against Zuniga, while the accused could produce several witnesses able to place him far from the scene of the crime at the time of the murder. Despite this, Zuniga was found guilty, and when lawyers Roberto Hernández and Layda Negrete learned about his case, they agreed to help. After it was revealed that the lawyer appointed to represent Zuniga did not have a valid license, authorities grudgingly agreed to a new trial, but with the same judge presiding, who showed little interest in evidence that Zuniga was falsely convicted. Battling an arrogant judge, uncooperative witnesses and a legal system riddled with corruption, Hernández and Negrete find its easy to prove Zunigas innocence, but hard to get the powers that be to acknowledge this fact.

Bye Bye is a muted and low-key ensemble drama about a shabby circus crawling from small town to small town through the Brazilian backwaters. As the curtain rises before us, the circus claims three participants: the slightly scary, medicine-show-like leader, Lorde Cigano (Jose Wilker), who sports a carnival-like 19th century mustache and cape, and keeps the audience mesmerized with magic tricks; the erotically charged, raven-haired dancer Salome (Betty Faria), ""Queen of the Rumba""; and the deaf-mute strongman Swallow, who doubles as a fire breather. The troupe quickly adds yet another member shortly after the story begins: the strapping young accordion player Cico (Fabio Junior). He signs on with the circus when he catches sight of Salome, and is thus lost to his expectant wife, Dasdo (Zaira Zambelli) forever -- despite his obligation to cart the missus along with the troupe. The preponderance of the drama explores the shifting relationships between the circus members over the course of their journeys; it also reveals how endangered the troupe has become, both by the inability of locals to pay (the performers accept melons and other edible goods as recompense) and by competing entertainments such as television. These endangerments will ultimately force Cigano and co. beyond desperation -- to the point of ending the circus altogether and prostituting out Salome and Dasdo, just to turn a buck. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi",R,"Art House & International, Comedy, Drama",Carlos Diegues,Embrafilme,115 minutes,"José Wilker, Betty Faria, Fábio Júnior"

Building on the lyrical style and naturalistic performances of his two previous features, DANCE PARTY USA and QUIET CITY, Katz offers a refreshingly idiosyncratic spin on genre conventions. He eschews the twisty plots and violence of modern neo-noir in favor of sly, deadpan humor and closely-observed performances.

Appropriately enough, Nouvelle Vague concerns the return of a man (Roger Lennox / Richard Lennox, played by Alain Delon, superstar of 60s and 70s international cinema) who may or may not have returned from the dead. The films narrative is extremely disjointed and might be better understood as an essay on the idea of returning. The theme of a return from the dead gives Godard the opportunity to come back to the religious imagery and theological considerations that interested him from 1983s Hail Mary. The films dialogue is a patchwork of unattributed quotations from works of literature, philosophy, and economics, a technique that Godard adopted in most of his films after this one.

Soo-jung (Lee Eun-ju of Tae Guk Gi) phones him after a while, and tries to get out of their planned tryst. They argue on the phone. The film then flashes back to show us, in numbered and sometimes titled episodes, how the relationship between these two characters developed. Jae-hoon was working as an assistant to a struggling filmmaker, Young-soo (Mun Seong-kun of A Petal). After several social engagements, Jae-hoon suggests to Young-soo that he might be interested in financing his next film. Jae-hoon begins to pursue Soo-jung, who keeps him at bay for a while. But Jae-hoon is persistent, and eventually, she relents. She lets him know that she is a virgin. Eventually, it becomes clear that Young-soo also has a romantic interest in Soo-jung. Jae-hoon gets jealous, and he and Young-soo get into a big argument, but they patch things up, and make plans to go to an expensive hotel on Cheju Island where, presumably, they will have sex.

William Holden, William Bendix and MacDonald Carey star as roguish outlaws Jim Dawkins, Wahoo Jones and Lorn Remming. After rescuing a little girl named Rannie Carter from a wicked tax collector, Dawkins and Jones decide to switch to the right side of the law; Remming, however, has other ideas. Years later, Rennie has grown up quite prettily into Mona Freeman, while Jim and Wahoo have become scrupulous members of the newly-formed Texas Rangers. Jim is in love with Rennie, but she has eyes for the still-crooked Lorn -- at least until Lorn proves to be the louse that the audience knew he was from the first reel. Streets of Laredo meticulously recreates the most famous scene from Texas Rangers, wherein one of the films more sympathetic characters is abruptly shot to death from under a table; the scene still works, though it packed a bigger wallop in the original.

2305,17564,Tatarak (Sweet Rush),nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"Polish heavyweight director Andrzej Wajda helms this unusual, way-offbeat project, whose complicated backstory explains the complex structure on hand. Ostensibly the tale of a middle-aged woman who grows obsessed with a much younger man in the years following World War II, while facing her own impending death at the same time, the film reached mid-production when lead actress Krystyna Janda lost her beloved husband to a terminal illness and began to work through the grief. Hit by creative inspiration, Wajda decided to modify the film by superimposing Jandas reading of a deeply intimate, confessional monologue onto the filmed material, thus commenting pointedly on the original work. The tale opens in a contemporary hotel room, shot with large, flat patches of light and shadow stylistically recalling Edward Hopper. Janda stands in the room, and as she walks around, speaks openly and passionately of cinematographer husband Edward Klosinski -- his diagnosis, his physiological decline, and ultimately his death. The narrative then cuts to the period section, with uncanny parallels to Jandas off-set experiences. Here, the actress stars as Marta, a European woman semi-happily married to a local physician (Jan Englert). He learns that she has contracted lung cancer, but deliberately resists informing her of her dire impending fate -- because shes already emotionally fragile given the death of their young sons during the war. Then, one day, Marta is walking with a friend when she catches a glimpse of a handsome, strapping 20-year-old man named Boguslaw (Pawel Szajda) and feels instantly drawn to his youth and sexuality. She then beckons him into a mentor-protégé relationship, which inevitably leads to an affair. Marta expresses her desire to collect rushes for the upcoming Pentecost feast, an event designed to celebrate life, and the passage of spring into summer -- but she doesnt realize that the freshness of life that beckoned her when she first spotted Boguslaw will ultimately be her undoing.",NR,"Art House & International, Drama, Special Interest",Andrzej Wajda,Akson Studio,85 minutes,"Krystyna Janda, Pawel Szajda, Jan Englert"

Despite their distinctive appearance (no hair, blue-tinted skin), they intermingle freely with humans at work, and have been granted some very limited rights under the law. But a backlash has developed among the humans -- the robots are often routinely referred to disparagingly as ""clickers,"" and some of the most militant opponents of the robots have organized The Order Of Flesh And Blood, a paramilitary vigilante group with its own intelligence, scientific, investigative, and surveillance services, all dedicated to limiting the presence, influence, and rights of the robots, in not eradicating them. One of their most active and ambitious members is Craigis (Don Megowan), a captain in the Order and also a top gerontologist in his professional life, who despises the humanoid robots for the threat he sees in their presence -- that with their physical and intellectual superiority, they force man to think less of himself, and to rely on the robots to do many of the tasks that man should do for himself. Craigis is more intelligent than a lot of his fellow Order members, who are little more than bully-boys throwing their weight around, but as such he also sees this struggle in more serious and dire terms than many of his colleagues. One night, while investigating a robot carrying a forged assignment card, he stumbles upon a series of events more ominous and astounding than any he could have anticipated -- a robot violates its First Law of behavior by murdering a man; and the robot committing the murder was designed to look and pass for human. Craigis feels he has stumbled onto something incredibly dangerous, but he is distracted from the implications of these events by news closer to home -- that his sister (Frances McCann) is now living in in an officially sanctioned raport with a ""clicker.""

Possessed of a splendid singing voice, our heroine rises to fame on the opera stage, while poor Jonathan continues struggling, supporting himself as a tour guide. Annette eventually saves her marriage by transforming her husbands ""masterpiece,"" a rather turgid modernistic opera, into a light-hearted musical comedy. Lucille Ball, whod later co-star with Henry Fonda in The Big Street and Yours, Mine and Ours, has a funny minor role as a gum-snapping tourist. Though Lily Pons was at least 10 years older than Fonda, they make an attractive and believable screen couple, adding credibility to this somewhat contrived yarn. And of course, Lily Pons is seen and heard to excellent advantage in a variety of solos, both brand-new (courtesy of Jerome Kern) and classical: In the closing production number, the svelte Ms. Pons is alluringly garbed in a revealing oriental costume, proving once and for all that women did have belly-buttons back in 1935!",NR,"Comedy, Drama, Romance",John Cromwell,RKO Radio Pictures,90 minutes,"Lily Pons, Henry Fonda, Osgood Perkins"

Beudet also fantasizes about laying waste to her husband - but every such hopeful wish fizzles out as she resurfaces in the reality of the everyday. Throughout the picture, Dulac uses such devices as slow motion, distortions, and superimposed images to paint Beudets various emotional states onscreen. Originally produced in 1923, Madame Beudet instantly established Dulac as a force in world cinema and is generally regarded as her masterwork. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi",NR,Drama,Germaine Dulac,nothing,nothing,"Germaine Dermoz, Alex Arquilliere, Jean D'Yd"

It is framed by the story of a Celestial tribunal convened to debate the worthiness of humanity following the invention of the hydrogen bomb sixty years ahead of schedule. Their arguments will determine whether or not the leader of the Supreme Tribunal (presumably God) will authorize the destruction of planet Earth. The Spirit of Man (Ronald Colman in his final film appearance) points out all of humankinds achievements for good while wily Satan (Vincent Price) calls men worthless. Both of their points are illustrated via vignettes. Highlights include Hedy Lamarr as Joan-of-Arc, a young Dennis Hopper as Napoleon and Peter Lorre as Nero. The Marx Brothers also made their final appearance as a team. Interestingly, each appeared separately. Groucho played a lusty Peter Minuit, the Dutchman who bought Manhattan from the Indians, while Harpo played Sir Issac Newton. Chico played a monk.

The ""all star"" cast lineup slowly dwindled down to comparatively inexpensive contract players Jimmy Durante and Jack Pearl (radios Baron Munchhausen) and a passel of non-MGM personalities. The final product wove a goofy story about The Great Schnarzan (Durante), a jungle-movie star whose films are suffering at the box office because his lions are anemic. Schnarzan schemes to purchase several healthy lions from Baron Munchhausen; to get the baron into a bargaining mood, Schnarzan throws a huge Hollywood party in Munchhausens honor. Liondora (George Givot), Schnarzans ""hated rival"", hopes to purchase the Barons lions for himself, and crashes the party disguised as a Greek Baron. Also figuring into the plot are the members of the Klemp family (Charles Butterworth, Polly Moran and June Clyde), who are filthy rich and thus quite attractive to both Schnarzan and Liondora; poor-but-honest Eddie Quillan, who romances the Klemps daughter; and Schnarzans ex-girlfriend Lupe Velez, who shows up at the party in an astonishingly revealing gown for the express purpose of making trouble. In an amusing animated sequence courtesy of Walt Disney, Mickey Mouse introduces the Technicolor musical exploits of ""The Hot Chocolate Soldiers."" Shortly before the end, Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy make a welcome appearance as a pair of lion-farm owners who wish to collect a debt from Baron Munchhausen. This segues into the classic egg-breaking sequence involving Stan, Ollie, and Lupe Velez. Now weve reached the 65 minute mark, with no logical ending in sight. Director Allan Dwan, brought into the project at the last minute, took a look at the existing footage and declared ""Its a nightmare!"" Inspired, Dwan directed a closing sequence which suggested that the whole plot had been dreamed by Jimmy Durante; Durante is wakened from his slumbers by his wife--played by Mrs. Jimmy Durante.

HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGER is a Film Movement release, runs for 103 minutes, is in Hebrew, English and Romanian with English subtitles, and is not yet MPAA-rated. The Human Resources Manager of Jerusalems largest bakery is in trouble. He is separated from his wife, distanced from his daughter and stuck in a job he hates. When one of his employees, a foreign worker, is killed in a suicide bombing, the bakery is accused of indifference, and the HR Manager is sent to the victims hometown in Romania to make amends. Far from home, on a mission to honor a woman he didnt even know but has somehow grown to admire, the HR Manager rediscovers his own humanity and his ability to truly care for human resources. Eran Riklis THE HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGER is based on an Israeli book that was recommended to him-A.B. Yehoshuas A Woman in Jerusalem (a New York Times notable book, and L.A. Times Book Prize winner, among other awards.) Keeping with the book, Riklis made the calculated decision not to name any of his characters (save the deceased woman inspiring the trip) but rather rely on their professions and personal attributes to identify and define them-the HR Manager, The Weasel, The Boy...

In response, a dying old prisoner prays to the gods to bring his people deliverance via the mythical being of the title. The Pulgasari soon arrives, initially as a horned and scaled, dragon-like creature of pint-sized stature (played by an actor in a clever costume). Though the beast seems diminutive and harmless enough to invite the description of ""cute"" from an onlooker, it begins devouring every piece of iron in sight (including sewing needles and then swords) - and as it does, it grows meteorically and eventually assumes Godzilla-like proportions, poised to rampage the aristocracy. Though it has a look virtually indistinguishable from Japanese monster pictures of the 50s, 60s and 70s, Pulgasari in fact emerged from North Korea under the supervision of dictator Kim Jong-Il. Acclaimed director Shin Sang-ok and his wife had been kidnapped from South Korea and imprisoned in the North for five years by Jong-Ils men. In 1983, however, Jong-il pulled Sang-ok out of jail and commissioned him to direct propaganda movies. The despot apparently wanted to use Pulgasari to spread collectivist ideology to the world at the height of the Cold War. Instead - and for reasons that are not entirely clear, but that may have to do with the films blatant kitschiness - this opus was widely banned and went unseen in North or South Korea for a decade, until it eventually arrived on video and became something of a cult favorite among sci-fi and fantasy aficionados. Meanwhile, Sang-ok and his wife found political asylum while attending the 1986 Venice Film Festival as representatives of North Korea, and spent the next 20 years living in exile in the United States, where Sang-ok produced several of the 3 Ninjas movies.

2638,19227,Carbon Nation,nothing,40%,15,76%,980,"Carbon Nation is a feature length documentary about climate change SOLUTIONS. Even if you doubt the severity of the impact of climate change or just dont buy it at all, this is a compelling and relevant film that illustrates how SOLUTIONS to climate change also address other social, economic and national security issues. Carbon Nation is an optimistic discovery of what people are already doing, what we as a nation could be doing and what the world needs to do to prevent (or slow down) the impending climate crisis. We already have the technology to combat most of the worst-case scenarios of climate change, and it is very good business as well. We meet a host of entertaining and endearing characters along the way, including entrepreneurs, visionaries, scientists, business, and the everyday man, all making a difference and working towards solving climate change. We interviewed over 200 people - included in the film are Richard Branson (CEO, Virgin Group), Thomas L. Friedman (New York Times), Former CIA Director James Woolsey, Van Jones (Founder, Green For All), Col. Dan Nolan, U.S. Army (Ret), Bernie Karl (Geothermal pioneer from Alaska,) Amory Lovins (Chairman, RMI), Art Rosenfeld (Commissioner, California Energy Commission), Denis Hayes (Founder of Earth Day), Ralph Cavanagh (NRDC), Lester Brown (Earth Policy Institute), John Rowe (CEO, Exelon), Jim Rogers (CEO Duke Energy), Cliff Etheredge (West Texas wind pioneer,)and more climate change pioneers. Public opinion is sliding the wrong way - far fewer people are concerned about climate change than even a year ago. Weve made Carbon Nation to give a majority of people an entertaining, informed and pragmatic primer about why its incredibly smart to be a part of the new, low-carbon economy: its good business. Carbon Nations optimism and pragmatism are appealing across the political spectrum. Carbon Nation is a film that celebrates solutions, inspiration and action. -- (C) Official Site",PG,"Documentary, Special Interest",Peter Byck,Mitropoulos Films,84 minutes,Bill Kurtis

2647,19288,Dreams That Money Can Buy,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"Surrealist painter and Dada film-theorist Hans Richter wrote, produced, and directed the experimental exercise Dreams That Money Can Buy, one of the most significant contributions to the 20th-century ""avant garde"" movement. The project began in 1944, while Richter was director of the Institute of Film Techniques at City College in New York. Combining short scenarios written by such world-renowned artists as Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamps, Man Ray, Alexander Calder and Fernand Leger, Richter came up with a full-color, feature-length study in dreamlike ""wish fulfillment."" The films only nod to continuity is the presence of a self-styled heavenly psychiatrist, whose patients purportedly visualize the images which play across the screen. Described by one observer as ""surreal yet somewhat Jungian,"" Dreams That Money Can Buy cost $25,000 and was three years in the making (Richter liked to take his time: his later Dadascope took five years!) Its New York premiere was greeted with a mixture of bravos and bewilderment, especially when the projectionist elected to show the film on the wall and ceiling rather than the screen. One assumes that the projectionist was less capricious when Dreams That Money Can Buy won a special prize at the 1947 Venice Film Festival.",NR,Special Interest,Hans Richter,nothing,99 minutes,"Max Ernst, Jack Bittner, Fernand Léger"
