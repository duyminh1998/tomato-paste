Huston worked as a screenwriter in the 1930s before getting his first chance to direct with The Maltese Falcon (1941). During World War II, Huston turned out a ""propaganda"" film titled Let There Be Light, which was so devastating in its depiction of shell-shock that the government ordered that it be removed from distribution. After the war, Huston directed such masterworks as Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Asphalt Jungle, Moulin Rouge and Moby Dick, as well as a few debacles (notably the benighted Red Badge of Courage). He also tilted with the infamous House UnAmerican Activities Committee. Declared washed up on several occasions, Huston kept bouncing back, even into the 1980s with such films as Under the Volcano and Prizzis Honor.

Because of the sexualinnuendo and the barely-there costumes it has largely been left out of the history books.In the 1840s burlesque was applied to a wide range of comedic plays that entertained the lower and middleclasses in Great Britain. Coming to America, burlesque evolved into shows performed by scantily-cladbeauties. It thrived, appealing to the masses of working class people who weekly stormed the theatres tosee troupes like ""The British Blondes"", a bevy of beauties dressed in tights. Burlesque poked fun at theupper classes, at sex, and at what people were willing to do in the pursuit of obtaining sex. By the 1920sthe old burlesque circuits closed and strip tease was introduced to offer something vaudeville and film didnot.During the Great Depression, for a dime a man could fall into a big gaudy burlesque show and forget histroubles. From theatres to nightclubs, burlesque was a raucous sexy show filled with gorgeous women,strippers, comedians, acrobats and singers. The tame by todays standards, the shows were consideredrisqué, and most performers were looked down on as second rate.Backed by public outrage, in 1937 New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia closed the burlesque houses in hisstate. The use of the word ""burlesque"" was outlawed in advertising. The Minsky brothers, who some sayintroduced nudity to the burly audiences, were so closely associated with burlesque that La Guardia bannedthe use of the name Minsky. Once again, burlesque changed, moving across the river to New Jersey toescape censure. Eventually comedians and musicians parts were reduced in the shows and more stripperswere brought on. By the 1960s hard-core porn was available and burlesque had died. But what happened tothe thousands of performers? Where did they go?""Behind the Burly Q"" is the behind-the-scenes stories of these men and women as told by the performersthemselves. For the first time ever, the performers from the golden age of burlesque relate theirheartbreaking, triumphant stories of life on the road performing in the burly circuit. Many were ashamed oftheir past and had never talked about their experiences. Just as many had never been asked.Director Leslie Zemeckis and producer Sheri Hellard traveled extensively across the country from theBayous of post-Katrina Mississippi, to New Jersey, Florida and all points between. The duo tracked downand recorded dozens of interviews with little-known performers to the last of the living legends ofburlesque. They spoke with relatives of many deceased stars. The men and women in this documentaryopened their scrapbooks as well as their hearts, relating memories they had all but forgotten.Amongst those interviewed were former musicians, strippers, novelty acts, club owners, funny men andwomen, authors and historians assembled together for the first time ever to tell you just what reallyhappened in a burlesque show. Sadly, many of the performers have since passed away, making this theirlast, and often times only interview. We dedicate this film to their memory.""Behind the Burly Q"" is the definitive history of burlesque during its heyday. Funny, shocking,unbelievable and heartbreaking, their stories will touch your hearts. Hear the performers in their ownwords. See the performers in action.

Everson as one of the fastest-moving crime melodramas of the 1930s (if not the fastest) Fog Over Frisco still manages to leave viewers breathless. Top-billed Bette Davis plays giddy heiress Arlene Bradford, whose perverse fascination with gangsters gets her mixed up in a stolen-securities scheme. Arlenes more sensible sister Val (Margaret Lindsay) tries to keep her out of trouble, but this proves impossible. Entering into the fray are hotshot society reporter Tony (Donald Woods) and goofy photojournalist Izzy (Hugh Herbert), who like Val get in over their heads when they stumble upon the body of the murdered Arlene. The identity of the killer remains a well-concealed secret until Izzy, of all people, stumbles across a vital clue. Things really begin to accelerate when Val is kidnapped by Arlenes gangster cohorts (who, interestingly enough, are very reluctant to take her prisoner and do so only when theres no other option!), leading to a mile-a-minute rescue and hasty plot wrap-up. Among the many good guys, bad guys and red herrings are Alan Hale as an Irish cop, Robert H. Barrat as a butler who isnt a butler, and Henry ONeill as a gosh-knows-what who may be the murderer. Though physical action is at a minimum, Fog Over Frisco is kept constantly on the move by director William Dieterle, using every cinematic trick and optical effect (wipe dissolves, iris-outs, swish-pans etc.) at his disposal.

580,20076,"Coluche, l'histoire d'un mec",nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"To the French, Michel ""Coluche"" Colucci (1944-86) was not merely a household name but a veritable institution. A stocky, goofy comic who often turned up in big screen farces such as LAile Ou la Cuisse (1976) and Inspecteur la Bavure (1980) , Colucci gained notoriety for his emotionally rocky and stormy personal life that witnessed him battling alcoholism and extreme drug addiction - making him something of a French equivalent to John Belushi or Chris Farley. Unlike Belushi or Farley, however, Coluche made the unusual decision (for one of his background) to briefly enter mainstream politics. In a bid for the French presidential nomination in 1981, he delighted many and shocked others by reeling in an impressive 15% of the French popular vote - reason enough to believe that this actor, with solid humanitarian values and a commitment to civil rights, might have actually stood a solid chance had he campaigned more aggressively and remained in the running for a longer period. Antoine de Cauness biopic Coluche, lHistoire dun mec hones in exclusively on this intriguing period of the comics life and career, with François-Xavier Demaison playing the famous actor. The tale begins with his impulsive and drug-fueled decision to run on the ticket, coaxing bums, drunks and social outcasts to band together and lay waste to mainstream politicians. When Coluche pulls in around 10% of the vote, he draws the ire of politicos François Mitterand and Valerie Giscard dEstaing, who promptly send out an advisor to dissuade the funnyman from running. Director de Caunes spends the majority of the film cross-cutting between recreations of Coluches popular stage acts, and a not uncritical look at the stars attempts to push himself to his very limits and beyond -- with a mainstream political run that began as a joke but quickly took on very real and frightening proportions.",NR,"Art House & International, Drama",Antoine de Caunes,nothing,nothing,"François-Xavier Demaison, Léa Drucker, Olivier Gourmet"

Once again, the exotic city of Istanbul is the place of intrigue. But, unlike Hamam, which was a contemporary story, Harem Suare takes place at the turn of the century in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. The locale of this ornate story of love, power, and fear is the magnificent Yildiz Palace, where Sultan Abdulhamit whiles away the time listening to the finale of La Traviata as rebellions rage all over the country. The Sultan cannot stand unhappy endings, so he has asked Safiye, his favorite concubine, who is Italian, to rewrite the libretto so that Violetta does not die. Nadir, one of the black eunuchs, has plans for Safiye, whom he thinks should become the official wife. Nadirs plans take a different turn when he and Safiye fall in love. In the harem, which is isolated from the rest of the world, life goes on with its plots and subplots, loyalties and betrayals, happiness and tragedies as if time did not exist. The story is told from the point of view of Safiye, concentrating more on human relations than on palace politics. The director plays with mirror images to reflect the two faces of personalities and the complexities of intercultural relations. Mythology is blended with sexuality, emphasizing the delicate nuances of language. The exotic element is not abused and historical details are used sparingly and only when necessary. Acting by young French actress Marie Gillain, who plays Safiye, and Lucia Bose, who plays her in old age, as well as Alex Descas as the eunuch Nadir and famous Turkish actor Haluk Bilginer as Sultan Abdulhamid are all commendable. 52nd Cannes Film Festival, 1999. ~ Gönül Dönmez-Colin, Rovi",R,"Art House & International, Drama",Ferzan Ozpetek,nothing,110 minutes,"Marie Gillain, Alex Descas, Lucia Bosé"

Then his ace salesman, Tommy Nelson (Regis Toomey), has a brainstorm -- let them take out the girls in the companys stenographic pool; after all, as he reasons it out, theyre nice girls and it will do them good to get out to a show and a good restaurant once in a while, and the buyers wont be hit up for cash or encouraged to give them expensive gifts. It will all be nice and innocent, or so he thinks, and the girls will get a bonus for their after-hours work -- although as one of the stenographers remarks, cautioning the others, ""You may get a lot more than a bonus from a buyer."" And that all works out until Tommys own secretary/fiancee, Florence Denny (Loretta Young), becomes the object of interest for rakish businessman Danny Drew (Lyle Talbot). Tommys jealousy kicks in and Flo is unfairly accused of being unfaithful. But her much more knowing, cynical friend Maizie (Winnie Lightner), whos been around the block a few times, shows her the truth -- that Tommy is no better or more faithful than the worst of the men who come into the office, and should be the last one to be making accusations. Now its Flos turn to be outraged, especially as he wont admit what he actually was doing. Soon their engagement is over and Flo is out of a job. Danny, trying to be a nice guy but clueless about what Flo is about, comes along with an offer that may get her lots of money but also wreck her reputation, and says something so awful about what he thinks she is, that she almost shocks the audience by agreeing to it. But she acquits herself in a way that is honorable and gets Danny what he wants in business -- a fact that has him thinking even less of her than he did before. For a time Flo is caught between Tommy and Danny, neither of whom thinks as highly of her as she deserves -- and she gets to Danny precisely how unfair he and almost every other man is to the women around them. The film ends in what is basically a race to see which of these two men wises up to how nice a girl she really is, and if they can wise up in time.

In Utah, a state where a significant number of residents are members of the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter Day Saints, a number of video store owners found it difficult to find popular films that their customers would find suitable for family viewing. One shop stepped forward with the notion of creating edited versions of recent hits, with nudity, adult language, drug use and violence clipped out using digital editing software. Calling their product ""Cleanflix,"" the sanitized versions of titles such as Titanic, The Big Lebowski and The Matrix were an immediate success, and a number of other Utah video stores followed suit. However, when Cleanflix and similar services began making their product available via mail order and the internet, not everyone was happy about it. The studios that owned the copyrights on the original films filed suit against the edited video services, asserting they were selling films that were not rightfully theirs, and a number of leading filmmakers (including Steven Spielberg, Steven Soderbergh and Martin Scorsese) launched a well-publicized campaign against movies being edited by outside parties for commercial use. Some of the edited movie dealers continued to operate in defiance of legal injunctions, though one found himself involved in a most unexpected scandal.

Billy Bright (Dick Van Dyke) narrates the story from his coffin, as he looks back on his life and career during his shabby funeral. In the early 1920s, vaudeville comic Bright goes to California to break into the movies, making a splash as he steals the show in his first short subject; he also steals Mary Gibson (Michele Lee), the leading lady, away from his director, Frank Powers (Cornel Wilde). Billy soon becomes one of the top funnymen in Hollywood after a series of successful two-reelers, and launches his own production company the same day he weds Gibson. But as Brights star rises, his worst qualities come to the surface; he becomes an arrogant alcoholic who cant stay faithful to his wife, and while his first feature film, Forget Me Not, is a major success, his career quickly goes into a tailspin, and with the arrival of the talkies Bright is a has-been. In the 1960s, with a revival of interest in silent films, Bright is able to make a few bucks appearing in television commercials, but it doesnt take much success for his bad habits to take hold again. Reiner and Van Dyke drew inspiration from the onscreen work and off-screen lives of several silent-era funnymen for the character of Billy Bright, most notably Stan Laurel, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; the film also features a fine supporting performance from Mickey Rooney as Billys faithful friend and sidekick, Cockeye.",PG,"Comedy, Drama",Carl Reiner,Columbia Pictures,96 minutes,"Dick Van Dyke, Michele Lee, Mickey Rooney"

As Merkin stumbles into a short-lived marriage with Filigree Fondle (Judy Cornwell) and enjoys a more successful relationship with Polyester Poontang (Joan Collins, Newleys spouse at the time), he finds it difficult to resist the temptation to bed nearly every attractive woman who crosses his path, and develops a lifelong obsession with the young, innocent, yet nubile Mercy Humppe (Connie Kreski).

In 1946, Ram (Kamal Haasan) was an archaeologist of the Hindu faith who believed the partition of Hindus and Muslims was ultimately destructive for both sides and regarded a Muslim, Amjad (Shah Rukh Khan), as one of his closest friends. But political turmoil resulted in the cancellation of a dig that employed both men, and Ram returned to his home in Calcutta. Subsequently, violence broke out between Muslims and Hindus in the city, and a gang of Muslin extremists invaded Rams home, raping and murdering his wife Aparna (Rani Mukharjee). Ram was traumatized by this event and soon joined a radical Hindu group, hoping to avenge his wifes fate before he returned to rural India and the village where he was born.

This chapter puts the Templars on a ghostly Spanish galleon (which looks like it was built from a ship-in-a-bottle kit), cloaked in perpetual fog and roaming the seas in search of victims. When two bikini models are set adrift as part of a sporting-good chains publicity stunt, they are seized by the flesh-eating ghouls. The companys frantic CEO sets out in his yacht to find them, accompanied by the head of the modeling agency, one of the models friends, and an expert on Templar lore. They eventually collide with the galleon, whereupon the meandering plot finally gets down to business. The blind, slow-moving zombies shamble up from below decks and wait patiently, as always, for their shrieking, flailing victims to stumble into their clutches.

The nominal plot involves five vacationing college kids -- Ash (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), and their classmates Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), Scott (Hal Delrich) and Shelly (Sarah York) -- making an unplanned stopover in an abandoned mountain cabin surrounded by impenetrable woods. Before settling in for the night, they come across an ancient-looking occult tome filled with dense hieroglyphics and macabre illustrations, a dagger fashioned from human bones, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The taped message, dictated by a professor of archaeology, describes the contents of the Sumerian ""Book of the Dead,"" filled with incantations used to bring otherworldly demons to life, giving them license to possess the living. The message goes on to explain that those possessed by these demons can only be stopped by total bodily dismemberment. When played among the group later that evening, the professors recorded translations of the ritual chants traumatize the strangely prescient Shelly ... and simultaneously release an ominous presence from the depths of the forest. The evil spirits take to their dirty work with gusto, first assuming control of Shelly and transforming her into a cackling, murderous hag with superhuman strength; the others imprison her in the fruit cellar and chain the trapdoor shut. The spirits then begin to possess the other women, including Linda -- who immediately turns on Ash with a barrage of punches and sadistic taunts. Unable to bring himself to chop up his lovers corpse, Ash gives her a more customary burial in the woods -- which proves to be a big mistake. As the others succumb to demonic influence, Ashs horrific predicament becomes increasingly grim until, when all hope seems lost, he stumbles upon a final, desperate solution to the ghoulish onslaught ... well, maybe not. Despite the shoestring production values, Raimi has fashioned a tight, lightning-paced fever dream of a movie, filled with operatic overacting and outrageously gory effects that give the project a comic-book feel. Based on an earlier 8mm short titled Within the Woods, this feature version was fraught with distribution difficulties before finding its first audience overseas. After considerable word of mouth (and a glowing endorsement from horror author Stephen King), the film became a hit on home video, where it achieved further notoriety thanks to its highly-publicized banning in Britain amid the notorious ""Video Nasties"" censorship campaign. Raimi, along with producer Robert Tapert, writer Scott Spiegel and much of the same crew, cranked up the storys comic aspects several dozen notches for the rollicking semi-remake, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn. ~ Cavett Binion, Rovi",R (for substantial graphic horror violence and gore),"Horror, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Sam Raimi,New Line Cinema,85 minutes,"Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker"

During the Fifties and Sixties, Castle was one of Hollywoods greatest and most shameless showmen, and he achieved some of his greatest box office successes with movies promoted with outlandish gimmicks. Castles reign as the King of Gimmicks began with 1958s Macabre, in which he gave each member of the audience a $1,000 insurance policy against being scared to death by the film. With his next release, 1959s House on Haunted Hill, theaters were equipped with ""Emergo,"" in which a plastic skeleton would fly through the theater on wires at certain moments in the action, and for The Tingler, released later the same year, seats were wired with electrical buzzers to give patrons a shock as ""materialized fear"" stalked the screening room. While Castle later took up more respectable projects -- most notably producing Roman Polanskis film Rosemarys Baby and collaborating with famous mime Marcel Marceau on the bizarre fantasy Shanks -- his playful, gimmicky horror films are still remembered by film fans today, and Jeffrey Schwartz pays homage to his life and career in the documentary Spine Tingler!: The William Castle Story. In addition to clips from many of Castles movies (as well as their trailers, many of which featured the director explaining his latest gimmick to prospective patrons), Spine Tingler! includes interviews with a number of fans and fellow filmmakers, including John Waters, Joe Dante, Leonard Maltin, Roger Corman and John Landis; the film received the audience award at the 2007 American Film Institute Film Festival.",NR,"Documentary, Television",Jeffrey Schwarz,Automat Pictures,82 minutes,"Forrest J Ackerman, John Badham, Diane Baker"

In the ensuing years, she and her husband Phillips Smalley acted in, directed, wrote, and edited films for Gaumont, Rex, and Universal. By 1914 Weber was a well-known director when she went to work for the Bosworth Company to make Hypocrites. Hypocrites is an amazingly complex film in both narrative and technique, following the parallel stories of an early Christian ascetic and a modern minister, with most actors in dual roles. Gabriel (Courtney Foote) is a medieval monk who devotes himself to completing a statue of ""Truth,"" only to be murdered by a mob when his work turns out to be an image of a naked woman. The contemporary Gabriel is the pastor of a large urban congregation for whom religion is a matter of appearances, not beliefs. The hypocrisy of the congregation is exposed by a series of vignettes in which the Naked Truth, literally portrayed by a nude woman, reveals their appetites for money, sex, and power. Hypocrites was a shocking and controversial film whose release was held up for many months by the difficulty of distributing a film with full nudity. Webers sincerity and reputation allowed her to use something that in the hands of a male director would have been considered scandalous and immoral. Widely admired at the time for extraordinary use of multiple exposures and intricate editing, Hypocrites propelled Weber to the front ranks of silent directors.",NR,Drama,"Lois Weber, George Loane Tucker",nothing,nothing,"Courtney Foote, Courtenay Foote, Elisabeth Risdon"

Flash forward to find the mutant siblings battling side by side through two world wars and Vietnam -- where they are sentenced to death for killing a commanding officer -- and Logan (Hugh Jackman) and his brother, Victor Creed (aka Sabretooth, played by Liev Schreiber), have joined a top-secret government task force. When their targets begin to include innocent civilians, conscientious Logan escapes to the Canadian Rockies, where he builds a home with pretty schoolteacher Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). Informed by his old commanding officer William Stryker (Danny Huston) that the members of his old team are being targeted for death, Logan is heartbroken when Victor finds and kills Kayla. Vowing revenge, Logan agrees to take part in a dangerous experiment that will fuse his bones with a powerful metal alloy called adamantium, which makes him virtually indestructible and gives him the strength needed to defeat his powerful brother. Subsequently betrayed by Stryker, Logan (now Wolverine) sets out to find his blood-lusting brother and stop the cycle of violence once and for all.

Yet, in our contemporary lore this mighty black-and-white mammal is like a two-faced Janus-beloved as a majestic, friendly giant yet infamous for its capacity to kill viciously. BLACKFISH unravels the complexities of this dichotomy, employing the story of notorious performing whale Tilikum, who-unlike any orca in the wild-has taken the lives of several people while in captivity. So what exactly went wrong? Shocking, never-before-seen footage and riveting interviews with trainers and experts manifest the orcas extraordinary nature, the species cruel treatment in captivity over the last four decades, and the growing disillusionment of workers who were misled and endangered by the highly profitable sea-park industry.

And in reality, the Explorer doesnt even exist - it represents only the latest in an endless series of paper-thin manipulative schemes.

Its 1974, but in a small village in Southern Turkey, the 20th century is only grudgingly acknowledged by most of the residents. The state of the art of entertainment is represented by open-air film screenings hosted by Latif (Cezmi Baskin), a sleazy opportunist with access to a collection of aged motion pictures from Turkey and France. Nazmi (Altan Erkekli), the mayor of the town, bitterly dislikes Latif and boycotts his screenings out of spite -- though he encourages his wife and children to watch the films for free from the rooftop of a nearby building. Nazmi, however, has learned of a new invention that could conceivably put Latif out of business once and for all -- a ""picture box"" that seemingly pulls images and sounds out of the sky. Television is all but unknown in the village, and Nazmi is the first man in town to own a set, but having a TV and getting a decent picture are two very different matters, and the search for a strong signal eventually leads to a journey up a nearby mountain. Latif, meanwhile, counters the news of the ""vision-tele"" everyone is talking about by spreading word that the TV is the work of the Devil and a slap in the face of Islamic tradition. Vizontele was written by Yilmaz Erdogan, who also collaborated on the direction with O.

Daikaju Baran is about a scientific party which discovers a prehistoric creature called Varan (opinions vary, but to some it looks like a flying, horned rodent). The monster naturally gravitates to Tokyo, wreaking plenty of havoc. Varan is destroyed by airborne explosives, which it voraciously -- and foolishly -- swallows. The American version grafts on a subplot about an experimental attempt to remove salt from sea water. The climax is virtually the only sequence that was left untouched in the American adaptation.

James Stewart plays Rip Smith, a cynical pollster who comes across a small American town named Grandview, which represents a ""perfect"" balance of ethnic types, professions, political beliefs, and personal opinions (a parody of the then-current ""Middletown"" study). Smith publicizes this discovery, leading to a barrage of media attention and an onslaught of get-rich-quick entrepreneurs. Not surprisingly, all of this has an adverse effect on the heretofore ""average"" citizens of Grandview; it also seriously threatens Smiths blossoming romance with local girl Mary Peterman (Jane Wyman), who feels that her friends and neighbors are being used, exploited, and in some cases, corrupted. The satirical thrust of the film bogs down into sentimentality toward the end, but its fun while it lasts. One of the colorful supporting characters is played by screwball-comedy favorite Donald Meek, who died during production, necessitating a number of hasty and not altogether successful rewrites.

Banished to their former honeymoon site in Venice, Italy while Nina thinks things over, Blume reflects on his past and his obsession, as he dreamily hopes for the best. Cutting between Blumes musings on love and loss in Venices Piazza San Marco and the events in L.A. that brought him there, Mazursky humorously yet sharply dissects the complications of marriage in the let-it-all-hang-out Me Decade of the 1970s.

We also see a rare and vivid portrait of middle-class African-American families as the parents wrestle with doubts and angst over their sons educational journey and both families grapple with how best to support their sons and interact with teachers and administrators. All of this is set against the backdrop of a persistent educational achievement gap that dramatically affects African-American boys at all socioeconomic levels across the country.

The project centers around a series of surgical techniques that are designed to create the ability for telepathic communication. The scientists are successful, and proceed to examine the interaction between the experimental subjects, especially the rise to dominance of one of the telepaths. As the study progresses, the researchers introduce the telepaths to various drugs, including aphrodisiacs, to increase the intensity of their bond and induce a state of ""omnisexuality.""

In his essay How Not to Write a Play, Kerr noted that the worst possible scenario would involve a drama critic forced to review a play written by his wife (we should mention that Kerrs own wife was noted playwright Jean Kerr). Levin utilized this very scenario, and the result was a Broadway hit. Less successful artistically was the 1962 film version, though with Bob Hope and Lucille Ball as stars, the film couldnt help but clean up at the box office. Hope portrays theatrical critic Parker Ballantine, while Lucille Ball plays his wife Angela. Feeling ""useless,"" Angela writes a play as a lark, then is amazed when it is optioned by a major producer. Parker does his best to get out of the responsibility of reviewing the play (which very well may be as bad as he thinks it is), but cannot escape the responsibility. Much of the verbal wit of the Levin original is sacrificed in favor of one-line quips; there is also an overabundance of gratuitous slapstick during a little-league game and the climactic ""opening night"" sequence.

Arne Treholt was a celebrated Norwegian diplomat who in 1984 found himself disgraced when he was accused of selling state secrets to the highest bidder. Treholt was found guilty and spent eight years behind bars before he was pardoned and freed. Treholt has always insisted he was innocent of all charges, and in Kommandor Treholt & Ninjatroppen, Malling imagines a scenario in which Treholt (played by Mads Ousdal) is a ninja warrior with powers of invisibility who leads a secret fighting force protecting their homeland against Cold War foes, represented by the sinister Meyer (Jon Oigarden), whose sympathies are clearly with the United States. As Treholt and Meyer wage a private war for control of Norways hearts and minds, Treholt tries to turn slobby slacker Humla (Amund Maarud) into a suitable second-in-command.

In the year 60 A.D., the Roman governor general Justinian (Don Murray) attempts to rule over the island from wisdom as well as strength, believing that winning over the hearts of the Iceni people will work better for the Empire than brutalizing them. He has help from his cultured advisor Tiberion (Niall MacGinnis), and finds an ally (and much more) in Salina (Carita), the daughter of the late King Priam ({Wilfred Lawson}), who has been chosen to rule the Iceni. Together, Justinian and Salina attempt to share responsibility for ruling the island nation, and to make the laws and the tax system fairer for the Iceni -- they also discover that they actually love each other and want to marry. Their romance and their attempts at bringing more civilized rule are thwarted by treachery on both sides. Among the Iceni, the Druids, led by the high priest Maelgan (Donald Houston), oppose the Romans because their rites (involving human sacrifice) have been banned, and Maelgan wishes Salina to fulfill the destiny that he has prophesized for her: to take up arms against the invaders. The wealthy Iceni merchants, led by the procurer Osiris (Dennis Shaw), oppose Justinian because of the higher taxes that he has imposed on them. Among the Romans, Justinians military commander, Octavian (Andrew Keir), doesnt care for diplomacy or persuasion, except at the point of a sword. Conspiracies abound in both camps, which leads to Justinian being called away, and, in his absence, Octavian destroys the treaty between the two peoples. Finally, Salina is forced to take up arms and lead her people in open revolt against the Romans. The two would-be lovers face each other in battle, where, in the achieving victory, Justinian learns precisely how fierce and proud a warrior and a queen Salina is. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi",NR,"Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Drama, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Don Chaffey,nothing,91 minutes,"Don Murray, Carita, Donald Houston"
