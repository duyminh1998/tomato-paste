While Max can no longer create, his eye for talent is as keen as ever, so he has become a successful art dealer, specializing in Modernists such as George Grosz.

One day, Max meets Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor), an emotionally intense, fellow war veteran who has found himself penniless in Munich. Adolf fancies himself an artist, and while Max isnt especially impressed with his technique, he sees in him a burning passion and a desire to communicate, so he encourages Adolf to express his demons through his art. While Adolf takes Maxs advice to heart and strikes up a friendship with him, Maxs friends find Adolfs open advocation of anti-Semitism rather troubling; Max, who is Jewish, simply chalks Adolfs attitudes up to unpleasant wartime experiences.
