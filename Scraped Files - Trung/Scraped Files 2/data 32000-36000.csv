But that interpretation gets dramatically rewritten by this lavish, sweeping chronicle produced at the height of a resurgence in Russian nationalism during the early 21st century. Here, as played by Konstantin Khabensky, Kolchak emerges as an admirable and commendable battle hero. The tale opens in 1916, with the military man holding court as a fearless, iron-willed, cunning leader; his only overriding weakness seems to be his slight and occasional infidelities to wife Sofia (Anna Kovalchuk). She tolerates this as well as she can, though in time, Kolchak falls helplessly in love with another woman -- Anna (Elizaveta Boyarskaya), the wife of officer Sergey Timirev (Vladislav Vetrov). As Kolchak struggles valiantly and courageously against the encroaching shadow of the Russian Revolution, both he and Anna realize that they will do literally anything to be together, and risk their lives and safety to make that happen -- up through the point when Kolchak meets a tragic but respectable end fighting on the Siberian tundras.

Before long, Animal Farm operates on but one principle: ""All Animals Are Created Equal, But Some Are More Equal Than Others."" Orwells ironic ending, in which it becomes impossible to tell the difference between the Pigs and the Humans, is blunted in favor of a grafted-on happy ending, perhaps to mollify the kiddie trade.

Cheryl Ladd has the looks and poise of the original Grace, though she isnt quite as charismatic. The early portion of the film retraces the stormy relationship between Grace and her gruff Philadelphia millionaire dad, Jack Kelly. The script suggests that Grace went through life looking for a strong father figure, finally finding one in Prince Rainier of Monaco (Ian McShane), whom she weds. Several ""celebrity look-alikes"" parade through the film, pretending to be the film personalities with whom Ms. Kelly worked during her brief Hollywood career. Grace Kelly tones down the darker aspects of its subject, and the film is infinitely more tasteful than most other TV biographies of the same period, even when dealing with Princess Graces untimely death. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",NR,Drama,Anthony Page,N/A,N/A,"Cheryl Ladd, Ian McShane, Salome Jens"

Focusing exclusively on the five years (1970-1974) that The Partridge Family was in production, the story is told from the viewpoint of Danny Bonaduce (played by a pre-Desperate Housewives) Shawn Pyfrom), and accordingly is colored by the sentiments so often expressed by the real, irrepressibly outspoken Bonaduce. Upon landing the coveted role of Danny Partridge, young Bonaduce must contend with the jealousy of his abusive father Joseph (William Russ); all the while, Danny is a sidelines observer of the effect that overnight stardom has on his coworker David Cassidy (Keith Partridge), who (it says here) despises all the idolatry and yearns for a normal life. Rather touchingly, the film recounts the surrogate son-surrogate father relationship between Danny and actor Dave Madden (Michael Chieffo), who was genuinely fond of his younger costars despite the kid-hating irascibility of his ""Reuben Kincaid"" character. The films highlight, which would be impossible to belief if it wasnt corroborated by witnesses, is the episode wherein Cassidy impulsively ""kidnaps"" Danny, whereupon both boys head off on a short journey of self-discovery; less easy to swallow is the scene which contrives a feud between the ""Partridge"" cast and the actors on the rival series The Brady Bunch (who are, interestingly enough, identified only by their character names and not their real names).

254,32401,La Rabbia di Pasolini,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"With his 1963 Rabbia (Rage), Pier Paolo Pasolini sought to construct an essay film out of found footage, that would enable him to impose his extreme Marxist ideological framework on some seminal events of the 20th century, thus telling history ""his way."" Using clips of such subjects as the Congo in the early 60s, atomic blasts from 1956, a celebrity visit by Sophia Loren to an eel festival, and exploitation of workers at a Fiat plant - accompanied by a prose poem, authored by Pasolini and then read by him on the soundtrack - Pasolini speaks out against bigotry, intolerance, middle-class hypocrisies, human complacency and a host of other ills that concerned him. His unusual method of juxtaposing unrelated images (and short-circuiting the audiences reactions in this way) anticipates his contributions to Dusan Makavejevs Sweet Movie in the mid-1970s, which employs similar associative techniques but waxes far more shocking. This film incurred a massive amount of trouble almost immediately after it went into production; its original producer, Gastone Ferrante, had the wild and antagonistic idea of turning the project into an episode film, of which Pasolinis segment would constitute 1/2; Ferrante asked the ultra-rightwing ideologue Giovanni Guareschi to do the other half, planning to ""pit"" the two halves against one another in the same program. This, of course, drew ire from Pasolini, who so detested Guareschis philosophies that he wanted nothing to do with the conservative. The picture was nevertheless released as planned, to dismal box office draws, and thereafter disappeared for 45 years. In 2008, a second, ""reconstructed"" version emerged (33 years after Pasolinis murder) and played at the Venice Film Festival, minus the Guareschi elements; retitled La Rabbia di Pasolini, it was supervised by Giuseppe Bertolucci, who receives co-directing credit with Pasolini and does a two-minute filmed introduction.",NR,"Art House & International, Documentary","Pier Paolo Pasolini, Giuseppe Bertolucci",N/A,N/A,"Giuseppe Bertolucci, Pier Paolo Pasolini"

Donald Ogden Stewart is careful to bring the pre-Depression frivolities of the Barry play up-to-date, first by changing the character of Grants best friend (played in both films by Edward Everett Horton) from a lazy socialite to a dedicated professor, and by including several lines indicating how out of touch the privileged classes are--and choose to remain--with 1930s realities. The only element in which the remake does not improve on the original is in the casting of Hepburns alcoholic younger brother; charming though Lew Ayres is in the 1938 film, he is still outclassed by Monroe Owsley in Holiday (1930). Katharine Hepburn managed to temporarily defray her ""box office poison"" onus when Holiday proved to be a success; alas, her next film, Bringing Up Baby (which reteamed her with Grant), was a financial bust, compelling her to return to Broadway--where she made a spectacular comeback in another Philip Barry play, +The Philadelphia Story.",NR,"Classics, Comedy, Drama, Romance",George Cukor,Sony Repertory,96 minutes,"Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Doris Nolan"

We open on the now-famous scenes of a remote, burning desert fort, manned by the dead Foreign Legionnaires, then flash back to the early lives of the Geste brothers. As children, the Gestes swear eternal loyalty to one another and to their family. One of the boys, young Beau (played as a youth by Donald OConnor), witnesses his beloved aunt (Heather Thatcher) apparently stealing a valuable family jewel in order to finance the Geste home; Beau chooses to remain silent rather than disgrace his aunt. Years later, the grown Beau (Gary Cooper) again protects his aunt by confessing to the theft and running off to join the Foreign Legion. He is joined in uniform by faithful brothers John (Ray Milland) and Digby (Robert Preston), who in turn are pursued by a slimy thief (J. Carroll Naish). The crook is in cahoots with sadistic Legion Sgt. Markov (Brian Donlevy, in one of the most hateful portrayals ever captured on celluloid), who is later put in charge of Fort Zinderneuf, where Beau and John are stationed. When the Arabs attack, Markov proves himself a valiant soldier; it is he who hits upon the idea of convincing the Arabs that the fort is still fully manned by propping up the corpses of the casualties at the guard posts. Beau is seriously wounded, and while the greedy Markov searches for the jewel supposedly hidden on Beaus person, he is held at bay by loyal John. The suddenly enervated Beau kills Markov, then dies himself--but not before entrusting two notes to John, one of which requests that John give Beau the ""Viking funeral"" hed always wanted (this is why the fort is in flames at the beginning of the film). After the battle, Digby Geste, a bugler with the relief troops, comes upon Beaus dead body, and appropriates the notes. As it turns out, John Geste is the only one who survives to return to England. He gives his aunt Beaus letter, which explains why Beau had confessed and run off--""a beau geste, indeed"" comments his tearful aunt. No one missed nominal leading lady Susan Hayward in this essentially all-male entertainment.

Flash forward to 1900: Having lost track of one another, the grown-up twins take separate compartments on the Orient Express. One of the girls (Segda again) has become the pampered mistress of a wealthy man; the other (Segda yet again) is a bomb-wielding anarchist. Director Ildiko Enyedi evidently intended My 20th Century as an allegorical statement concerning the status of women in the modern mechanical age. The experiences of the twins are interspersed with shots of Thomas Edison (Peter Andorai), whom we see at the beginning of the film perfecting his incandescent light bulb on the very day that the sisters are born. The more technological advances made by Edison, the more confused the twins become in establishing their own roles in an advancing civilization.

Van Dyke, Freuchen, and cinematographer Ray Wise also played prominent on-screen roles in the film. Eskimo Ray Mala (billed only by his last name) essays the title role, speaking in the tongue of his ancestors (even though his English was excellent). Rather than use superimposed titles, Van Dyke resorted to old-fashioned silent-movie subtitles in several dialogue sequences. The story concentrates on the more exotic aspects of Eskimo life, notably the races (alleged) casual approach to sex. Though tribal leader Mala has, by his own admission, slept with 20 women without benefit of clergy, woe betide anyone who tries to steal his current sweetheart -- as a rapacious trader discovers when hes harpooned to death by the cuckolded hero. Mala is ultimately undone by the Canadian Mounties, whose efforts to civilize the Eskimo community result in a sudden and tragic shift of the balance of power. Editor Conrad A. Nervig won an Oscar for his Herculean efforts to bring cohesiveness to the story.

When Colin is not whining about his need for stimulation and his particular interest in the rat-like bisexual jailer Ambert and espousing his impulsive philosophies, he is criticizing the Marquis work, some of which is illustrated via claymation. The Marquis is in trouble for allegedly raping and impregnating the cow-faced Justine, who was really victimized by the king, something the camel-headed priest Don Pompero, and the cocky Gaetan De Preaubois, try to keep secret. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries prepare to stage a coup and depose the king. ~ Sandra Brennan, Rovi",R,"Animation, Art House & International, Comedy, Special Interest",Henri Xhonneux,N/A,N/A,"François Marthouret, Valérie Kling, Michel Robin"

Jenks moves into the facility in June 2005, with assistant director William Godel and cinematographer Quickmire Pettigrew in tow, who utilizes a tiny, unobtrusive 24p video camera to document the experience - thus achieving candor and intimacy. The film not only observes the aging process and the state of institutionalized care for the elderly (most of whom are octogenarians and nonagenarians) but studies the burgeoning (and utterly unexpected) cross-generational friendships that develop between Jenks and many of his newfound housemates. The film introduces us to such seniors as jocky 80-year-old Bill Delarm, who is initially introverted and laconic but who ultimately breaks down and becomes one of Jenkss best friends; 95-year-old Tammy Signorile, a devoted companion to two other women in the facility; blind Libby Smith; and Dotty Shepard, who sinks rapidly into debilitating illness over the course of the picture. Jenks includes many memorable sequences throughout, including an instance where the power in the home cuts out during a lightning storm, terrifying many residents. The final scenes of the picture witness Jenks departing with a firsthand, heightened knowledge of the elderly and a grave sadness at the thought of leaving his new friends behind - as well as a concern over their collective physical deterioration. From outset to conclusion, the approach remains sensitive, compassionate, and delicately-handled.",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest",Andrew Jenks,N/A,N/A,"Andrew Jenks, Bill Delarm, Tammy Signorile"

""Mademoiselle Fifi"" is the derisive nickname of a brutal Prussian officer (Kurt Krueger) who rules the roost in a tiny French village. When a stagecoach rides into the village, the passengers are detained by the Prussian tyrant, who threatens to kill them all at any given moment. Desperately, the passengers demand that one of their own, a laundress of dubious morals named Elizabeth (Simone Simon), surrender herself sexually to the Prussian to secure their freedom. Previously the object of scorn and ridicule from her fellow passengers, Elizabeth is bitterly amused by their change of heart, but shes too loyal to France to refuse their request. How she completes her ""mission"" and eliminates ""Mademoiselle Fifi"" in the process is the films dramatic core. Though superbly directed by Robert Wise, Mademoiselle Fifi is laid low by its pretentiousness-not to mention the uneveness of the performances, none more uneven than Jason Robards Sr., who at one point declaims in his flat midwestern tones ""We must not forget that were all Frenchmen!""",NR,Drama,Robert Wise,RKO Pictures,69 minutes,"Simone Simon, John Emery, Kurt Kreuger"

Though Russell was a classically trained composer and cellist with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of indigenous Indian music, this performer quickly branched off in a more offbeat and unusual direction. The Oskaloosa, IA, native fixated on such counterculture icons as John Cage and Timothy Leary at an early age, then ran away from home during adolescence and joined a Frisco-based Buddhist group. Russell became acquainted and associated with poet Allen Ginsberg, then moved to New York City, where (like Cage) he established himself as a veritable fixture in the underground music scene and worked as the music director for The Kitchen. By the mid-70s, Russell began producing prescient disco records in the pre-Gibb days, under colorful pseudonyms such as Indian Ocean and Loose Joints. Unfortunately, he never culled the devoted following that he deserved until about 15 years after his death. Wolf employs a fractured film-essay style throughout the film, intercutting such materials as archival footage, extracts of musical compositions by Russell, and revealing interviews with Russells family. Thematically, the director uses the tale of Russells colorful life as a springboard into investigations of broader subjects and themes including gay lifestyles in the early AIDS era, the sociocultural landscape of Manhattan (and the cultural underground) during the 1970s and 80s, and the importance of staking out new directions in art and music for an innovative mind such as Russells.",NR,"Documentary, Musical & Performing Arts, Special Interest",Matt Wolf,Plexifilm,71 minutes,"Bob Blank, Ernie Brooks, Steven Hall"

A narrative story unfolds within the context of the film but is embedded in divergent scenes of New York City and occasionally unrelated soundscapes that mesmerize the viewer. Writer/director Ben Speth creates the character of Alex to use as his subject in this study of random happenings called life. The story follows Alex, a thirty-eight-year-old dancer, as she goes through the motions of her day--drinks with a girlfriend, fighting with her boyfriend, dance rehearsal, infidelity--and effectively shows the discontent in her life. Anne Iobst plays Alex with such honesty and grace that you quickly forget that she is really a fictional character. Speth shows the events of Alexs day but does not go any further; thus, the end of the film is not the end of the story--life goes on. He successfully introduces experimentation and abstraction to the medium of motion pictures, which usually emphasizes control, structure, and complacency. Speths many unconventional techniques leave a good portion of the interpretation of Alex up to the viewer.

If one is to believe the script of this made-for-cable film, Williams hadnt intended the Crips to wallow in crime and violence; instead, hed hoped that the gang would form a united front to protect his hood from other gangbangers. Needless to say, it didnt turn out that way, and within a few years of its 1971 formation, the Crips was the biggest and most powerful gang in the country, with branches in virtually every state. Ultimately, Williams is charged with murder and sentenced to San Quentins death row in 1987. There he experiences an epiphany and becomes an advocate for peace, harmony, and tolerance, writing childrens books that preach against the lure of street gangs. As the years roll by and the date of his execution draws closer, Williams manages to negotiate a peace between the Crips and their chief rivals, the Bloods, and even manages to receive three Nobel Prize nominations. Lynn Whitfield co-stars as Barbara Becnel, the crusading journalist who helped Williams see the light -- not so much to save his soul, but to prevent a similar fate from befalling her own son. Although considerable liberties are taken with the facts, Redemption: The Stan ""Tookie"" Williams Story neither glamorizes nor excuses its title character, nor the ""gangsta"" culture that he so enthusiastically embraced in his youth.

One of the more curious entries in this effort was The Negro Soldier. The structure of the film is that of a black minister who preaches a sermon to his all-black congregation. Over the course of 40 minutes, the minister recounts the contributions of blacks in American military history, from Crispus Attucks and the Boston Massacre to the men who served in WWI, along the way touching on the War of 1812, the Civil War, the exploration of the West and the building of the railroad, the Spanish-American War, and the building of the Panama Canal. Throughout, the filmmakers blend archival footage and Hollywood re-creations to illustrate the preachers words, and even include a re-creation of the destruction by the Nazis of a WWI monument in France to African-American soldiers. The film then slips into a more general history, telling of Booker T. Washington, George Washington Carver and the roles blacks have played in such fields as law, medicine, global exploration, music, education, art, academia, and athletics. The second half of The Negro Soldier moves into the present, describing the crimes of the Germans and Japanese and filling the screen with graphic images of hangings, bombings, and bodies; following the sentimental story of a young man through basic training; and wrapping up with a slew of images showing African-Americans serving in all aspects of military life, from infantrymen and tank destroyers to engineers and quartermasters. The Negro Soldier was written by Carlton Moss, who would become an important figure in African-American independent cinema, and the following year the U.S. Navy released a follow-up of sorts, The Negro Sailor.",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest","Frank Capra, Stuart Heisler",N/A,N/A,Carlton Moss

Ray spots would-be bank teller Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) at a gambling spot and, figuring him for an easy mark, lifts his wallet -- only to discover Claude is broke. Ray and Claudes mutual need to raise some cash brings them together when Spanky offers them a job bringing back a load of moonshine from bootleggers in the deep south. However, things dont go well for Ray and Claude, and theyre arrested by a sheriff in Mississippi who recently killed a man and needs someone on whom he can hang the charge. Since Ray and Claude are black, from out of town and have been caught red-handed with a load of illegal liquor, the sheriff figures theyre easy pickings and frames them for the murder. Soon the two men are inmates in a Southern work camp, where they spend the next 55 years learning to get along with the other inmates, avoiding the wrath of the guards, seeing younger prisoners come and go and never losing hope that someday, somehow, their innocence will be proven and theyll be released. Life is the second screen pairing for Murphy and Lawrence, who also shared screen time in 1992s Boomerang, and was scripted by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone from an original idea by Murphy.

841,33239,Delirium,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Italian filmmaker Renato Polselli (aka Ralph Brown) wrote and directed this wonderfully sick and demented giallo thriller, a shining example of the sort of outrageous psychosexual perversity for which the genre has become cherished by cult enthusiasts. Former Mr. Universe Mickey Hargitay was already a sleaze favorite for his turn as Il Boio Scarlatto and his disingenuously tearful tour of his late wifes estate in The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield. Hargitay only solidifies that image here as Prof. Herbert Lyutak, a perverse sex maniac employed as a criminal psychologist. Lyutak is first seen giving a young woman a ride in his car, eventually attacking her and chasing her through the woods to a creek, where he beats her to death. Lyutaks wife (Rita Calderoni) finds his bloody shirt, but because there is another murder while the demented shrink is consulting the police, he is cleared. Working with the authorities, Lyutak has a family friend (Katia Kardinali) pose as a prostitute to catch the killer, but he simply murders another hooker not far away. The bodies continue piling up, with so many alibis and confusing contradictions that it soon becomes apparent the killings are the work of several hands. Polselli keeps the sleaze factor high throughout, notably in some psychedelic nightmare sequences featuring Lyutaks fantasies of torturing nude women in his basement and in the murder of Kardinali, which features some fairly graphic whipping and kinky sexual allusions. Theres also lesbianism, strangulation, and an interesting synth-rock score by Gianfranco Reverberi to keep viewers interested, and the ultimate conclusion is -- in keeping with the title -- a delirious, bloody battle between three psychopaths in a cellar. Thats only in the original version, however, because the American re-edit removed most of the sleaze, changed the setting from England to the United States, and added two extra murders and a police shootout, not to mention some dubious Vietnam flashbacks. The ultimate entertainment value to genre enthusiasts, therefore, is highly dependent on which version they see, as the extensive changes reduce a wild, flamboyant shocker to just another dull mystery.

Murnaus Sunrise represents the art of the wordless cinema at its zenith. Based on the Hermann Sudermann novel A Trip to Tilsit, this ""Song of Two Humans"" takes place in a colorful farming community, where people from the city regularly take their weekend holidays. Local farmer George OBrien, happily married to Janet Gaynor, falls under the seductive spell of Margaret Livingston, a temptress from The City. He callously ignores his wife and child and strips his farm of its wealth on behalf of Livingston, but even this fails to satisfy her. One foggy evening, OBrien meets Livingston at their usual swampland trysting place. She bewitches him with stories about the city -- its jazz, its bright lights, its erotic excitement. Thrilled at the prospect of running off with Livingston, OBrien stops short: ""What about my wife?"" Drawing ever closer to her victim, Livingston murmurs ""Couldnt she just...drown?"" (the subtitle bearing these words then ""melts"" into nothingness). In his delirium, the husband agrees. The plan is to row Gaynor to the middle of the lake, then capsize the boat. Gaynor will drown, while OBrien will save himself with some bulrushes that hed previously hidden in the boat; thus, the murder will look like an accident. The next day, the brooding OBrien begins slowly rowing his unsuspecting wife across the lake. Halfway to shore, he makes his intentions clear, but is unable to go through with it. As his wife cringes in terror, OBrien rows to the other side of lake. Once ashore, she runs away from him in terror, as he stumbles after her, trying to apologize. Gaynor boards a streetcar bound for the city, with OBrien climbing aboard a few seconds afterward. Upon reaching the city (a renowned set design), OBrien continues trying to make amends to his wife. They sit disconsolately at a table in a restaurant, unable to eat the plate of cake that is set before them. Slowly, Gaynor begins overcoming her fear. The couple wander into a church, where a wedding is taking place. Breaking down in sobs, OBrien begins repeating the wedding vows, thereby convincing Gaynor that she has nothing to fear. Together again, the couple embraces in the middle of a busy street, oblivious to the honking horns and irate motorists. Anxious to prove to each other that all is well, the husband and wife spend a delightful afternoon having their pictures taken and ""dolling up"" in a posh barber shop. They cap their unofficial second honeymoon at a joyous festival in an outsized amusement park. More in love with each other than ever before, OBrien and Gaynor head back across the lake in the dark of night. Suddenly, a storm arises. Pulling out the bulrushes with which hed planned to save himself, OBrien straps them onto Janet, telling her to swim to shore. The storm passes. Washing up on shore, the unconscious OBrien is brought home. But Gaynor is nowhere to be found, and it is assumed that she has died in the storm. Half-insane, OBrien strikes out at Livingston, the instigator of the murder plan. Just as he is about to throttle the treacherous temptress, he is summoned home; his wife is alive! As Livingston stumbles out of the village, OBrien and Gaynor cling tightly to one another, watching the sun rise above their now-happy home. Together with Seventh Heaven, Sunrise earned Janet Gaynor the first-ever Best Actress Academy Award, while Charles Rosher and Karl Struss walked home with the industrys first Best Photography Oscar.

A dreamer who believes in the perfect world depicted in the pop songs, Arthur is frustrated by financial worries and a strained, sexless marriage. Seeking an escape, on a business trip he falls in love with a small-town teacher; pretending to be a wealthy songwriter, he courts her, and finds a kindred spirit. However, despite the promises of the love songs, they soon finds themselves headed towards further challenges and a potentially tragic end. Potter and director Piers Haggard create a unique sort of musical by using pre-existing songs and setting them in distinctly realistic contexts, contrasting the idealistic, carefree songs with the harsher economic, social, and interpersonal realities of the surrounding world. ~ Judd Blaise, Rovi",NR,"Drama, Musical & Performing Arts",Piers Haggard,N/A,N/A,"Bob Hoskins, Gemma Craven, Kenneth Colley"

The film centers around the complex relationship between two brothers: Sung Tse-kit (Leslie Cheung) is a recent graduate of the police academy while Tse-ho (Ti Lung) runs a massive counterfeiting ring along with his gangland associate, Mark Lee (Chow Yun-fat). Tension between the two brothers comes to a head when their father is murdered after a crime deal goes sour and Tse-ho lands in jail after being double-crossed. In perhaps the most influential scene in Hong Kong cinema in the 1980s, Mark avenges his friend by staging a dinner table assassination. As Mark tries to shoot his way out of the restaurant, pulling a series of hidden pistols from potted plants and alcoves, he gets horribly injured. With both founding members of the counterfeiting syndicate incapacitated, the operation falls into the hands of Shing (Waise Lee Chi-hung), Tse-hos former underling who has little of his boss élan or experience. When Tse-ho gets out of jail, he reunites with his now-crippled comrade, Mark, to take out Shing and to protect Tse-kit whose life is in danger for investigating their former subordinate. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi",R,"Action & Adventure, Art House & International, Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Hae-sung Song,CJ Entertainment,95 minutes,"Yun-Fat Chow, Leslie Cheung, Lung Ti"

Katharine Hepburn and Doris Nolan play Linda and Julia Seton, two daughters of a very well-to-do family. Linda feels a bit lost in the shuffle as sister Julia prepares to marry self-made financier Cary Grant. Hepburn has always rebelled against her privileged trappings, and finds a kindred spirit in the unorthodox, iconoclastic Grant. On the verge of compromising his down-to-earth values with his marriage to the wealth-obsessed Nolan, Grant chooses instead to plight his troth with soul-mate Hepburn, celebrating his ""liberation"" by doing several cartwheels. Donald Ogden Stewart is careful to bring the pre-Depression frivolities of the Barry play up-to-date, first by changing the character of Grants best friend (played in both films by Edward Everett Horton) from a lazy socialite to a dedicated professor, and by including several lines indicating how out of touch the privileged classes are--and choose to remain--with 1930s realities. The only element in which the remake does not improve on the original is in the casting of Hepburns alcoholic younger brother; charming though Lew Ayres is in the 1938 film, he is still outclassed by Monroe Owsley in Holiday (1930). Katharine Hepburn managed to temporarily defray her ""box office poison"" onus when Holiday proved to be a success; alas, her next film, Bringing Up Baby (which reteamed her with Grant), was a financial bust, compelling her to return to Broadway--where she made a spectacular comeback in another Philip Barry play, +The Philadelphia Story.",NR,"Classics, Comedy, Drama, Romance",George Cukor,Sony Repertory,96 minutes,"Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Doris Nolan"

The detective assigned to the case, Tom Beck (Michael Nouri), thinks that he notices a strange look in the eye of the thief, but when FBI agent Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan) informs Tom that hes also been assigned to the case, he thinks that he sees the same curious look in Lloyds eyes as well. Lloyd also has an odd way of carrying himself, as if hes not entirely in control of his own body, and in time, Tom discovers what the two men have in common -- both are actually aliens from another planet. They are creatures from another world capable of entering a human (or animal) body at will and using it as a vessel as long as they need. When the stockbroker died, the rogue alien simply crept into another body to begin his crime spree all over again. Lloyd has been sent to Earth to bring the thiefs reign of terror to a halt and has taken over the body of an FBI agent with that in mind.

The story begins with television reporter/anchor Karen White (Dee Wallace) taking part in a dangerous police operation intended to trap psychopath Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). When confronted by Eddie face to face, she witnesses something horrifying enough to trigger selective amnesia. Plagued by a series of violent nightmares, Karen decides to admit herself to a posh recovery resort known only as ""The Colony,"" run by her eccentric New Age therapist, Dr. Waggner (Patrick MacNee), and brings along her husband, Bill (Christopher Stone), for support. The night after they arrive, Karen and Bill are unnerved by eerie howling in the woods. Back in the city, Karens co-workers Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terry (Belinda Balaski) have been investigating Eddies background after discovering that his body has disappeared from the morgue. Sifting through Eddies possessions, they find a strange collection of artwork depicting wolf-like creatures, and decide to consult with Walter Paisley (Dick Miller, of course), the owner of an occult bookshop, on werewolf lore. Though he claims not to believe in the stuff hes selling, Paisley nevertheless convinces Chris to purchase a handful of silver bullets...just in case. Back at the colony, Dr. Waggner has organized a hunting party after hearing Karens account of the nocturnal howling, but the men find nothing but a rabbit, which Bill is told to bring to the cabin of the sultry Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks) to prepare for dinner. After resisting Marshas less-than-subtle sexual overtures, Bill is attacked by a wolf while returning to his cabin. The following moonlit night, the sleepless Bill wanders outside to find Marsha waiting and the two make love by the campfire, their bodies undergoing a frightening transformation. Just as Karen is beginning to suspect that her husband is hiding a secret far more threatening than marital infidelity, Chris and Terry have come to realize -- too late, in Terrys case -- that Eddie Quist is not only still alive, but not quite human...and he knows hes being followed. Chris arrives at the colony too late to save Terry, but manages to find Karen just as the colonys residents -- all of whom are werewolves, including Dr. Waggner -- are assembling to decide her fate. Dante fills his film with heartfelt homages to The Wolf Man and other classic horror movies, as well as a few clever visual puns and in-jokes from his tenure with Roger Corman, but never strays from the path to genuine horror, particularly when Rob Bottins chilling monsters are onscreen.","R (adult situations/language, nudity, violence)",Horror,Joe Dante,MGM Home Entertainment,91 minutes,"Dee Wallace, Patrick Macnee, Dennis Dugan"

1352,33963,The Edge Of Dreaming,N/A,100%,5,100%,167,"This is the story of a rational, sceptical woman, a mother and wife, who does not remember her dreams. Except once, when she dreamt her horse was dying. She woke so scared she went outside in the night. She found him dead. The next dream told her she would die herself, when she was 48. The Edge of Dreaming charts every step of that year. The film explores life and death in the context of a warm and loving family, whose happiness is increasingly threatened as the dream seems to be proving true. From the kids reaction to their horses death (they taught the dog a new trick - called dead dog), the film mixes humour, science and married life as Amy attempts to understand what is happening to her. Everyone wrestles with the concept of their own mortality, but few so directly explore and confront the subject. When Amy fell seriously ill, as her dream predicted, she went on a search to change that dream, leading her to eminent neuroscientist Mark Solms, and to new understanding of the complexity of our brains. The final confrontation takes us back into her dream with the help of a shaman, revealing a surprising twist to the tale. -- (C) Official Site",NR,"Documentary, Kids & Family, Special Interest",Amy Hardie,N/A,N/A,"Amy Hardie, Peter Kravitz, Eli Hardie-Howes"

The story begins with a deranged hag attempting to kidnap an infant for a Satanic sacrificial rite, then committing suicide after being captured by the police. The womans evil spirit then takes possession of the police inspectors ten-year-old daughter, who launches into the standard collection of demon-possession symptoms (profanity, levitation, head-spinning, etc.) before physically transforming into a miniature version of the deceased witch. As people begin dying all around her in horrific ways, the demonic brat attempts to steal another child and complete the sacrificial rite -- until a priest steps in to stop her reign of terror. Atmospheric but uncomfortably grim and violent, this film has a particularly pessimistic ending which lends to the overall sense of doom.

They Died With Their Boots On, audiences in 1941 ate it up like cotton candy. In the gospel according to Warners, General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) is neither an arrogant fool nor a rabid Indian hater. Instead, he is a flamboyant but brilliant cavalry officer, who during the Civil War defies his superiors orders and becomes a hero as a result. After a period of forced retirement in the postwar years, Custer is put in charge of the 7th Cavalry in the Dakota Territory. Here he whips this ragtag group into spit-and-polish shape, and also does his best to extend a neighborly hand to the local Indian tribes. Custer even goes so far as to promise Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) that the white man will never set foot in the sacred Black Hills. Alas, Custer is betrayed by greedy gold prospectors, whipped into a frenzy by scheming (and fictional) land speculator Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy). Forced by circumstances to do battle against Crazy Horse to prevent tribal retaliation, Custer and his command ride towards a rendezvous with destiny at the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876. Though some of the historical inaccuracies in the film are real howlers, blame cannot be laid solely at the feet of Warner Bros.; the Custer legend had previously been perpetrated by the generals loyal widow Elizabeth Bacon (played herein by Olivia de Havilland), then eagerly elaborated upon by Eastern news journalists and dime novels. This film represented the final screen pairing of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, a fact that lends poignancy to their classic parting scene.

Beginning with the horrifying torture, crucifixion, and flaming deaths of a group of nuns beneath a convent in 1486 Sicily (reminiscent of the opening murder of the warlock in LAldila), the film then flashes forward to modern-day Toronto, where Liza (Meg Register) has visions of their deaths at a séance (as in the opening of Paura nella Citta dei Morti-Viventi). Naturally, Liza soon finds herself in Sicily, along with archaeologist Professor Paul Evans (Brett Halsey) and his colleague, Porter (Al Cliver). Nosing around the convent, she breaks open the crypt, unleashing the nuns expectedly bloody occult vengeance. People are impaled on spikes, a woman (Carla Cassola) has her eyes ripped out by her pet cats, a mean butcher (Lino Salemme) has a meathook driven through his neck and his tongue nailed to a board, and so on. Things reach a predictable frenzy with an angry mob, a nun with no face, demonic possession, and a man ripped completely in two. Theres also a bizarre back story about the nuns seducing local youths and murdering them at the moment of orgasm to obtain their blood for Satanic rituals. None of it makes much sense, and most fans of the director seeking a return to form found Demonia a pale imitation of his notorious Gothics, particularly coming so soon after Michele Soavis similar -- and more successful -- La Chiesa. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi",NR,"Anime & Manga, Art House & International, Horror",Lucio Fulci,N/A,N/A,"Carla Cassola, Al Cliver, Lucio Fulci"

1741,34629,The Outrage,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Derived from Rashomon, the classic 1951 Japanese film, The Outrage attempts to modernize the original story of rape and murder, transporting from medieval Japan to the American Southwest of the 1870s. The story is told within the framework of three men waiting at a railway station. A con-man (Edward G. Robinson) listens to the account of a trial held recently in the town as told by a prospector (Howard Da Silva) and a preacher (William Shatner) suffering from a crisis of faith in humanity. Three witnesses at the trial of a Mexican outlaw give conflicting testimony. Each version is shown in flashback. The outlaw, Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman), confesses that he bound the husband (Laurence Harvey), raped the wife, and killed the husband in a duel of honor. The wife (Claire Bloom) claims that the outlaw raped her, and then she stabbed her husband when he contemptuously blamed her for inviting the assault. The third witness, an old Indian (Paul Fix), declares that he found the dying husband who stated that he stabbed himself because he couldnt live with the humiliation. At this point, the narrative is interrupted by an abandoned babys cry. The child has gold hidden in his clothing which the con-man attempts to appropriate. Then the discussion of the trial continues, turning brusquely from drama to parody. The prospector admits that he witnessed the rape, but that the wife nagged the two men into fighting over her. The husband tripped and fell on his own knife. The prospector, who stole the jeweled knife from the dead body, chose not to appear in court. Possibly out of some desire for redemption, the prospector decided to care for the abandoned baby, and the preacher regains faith from the supposed altruistic action. The eerily deserted train station and the strong black-and-white cinematography contribute a mild surreal quality to the film, but can do little to save the story from its flaws. The changes in the characters necessary to accommodate the new setting cause them to lose important symbolic significance in the translation. Despite a star cast and strong acting, the new version is mediocre at best.

1746,34636,Omnibus: King Lear,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"One of the first important distinctions to be made about this version of King Lear is that it is not the same version directed by Peter Brook in 1971. Brook was responsible for the staging of this 1953 version, but it was Andrew McCullough who put it to film. Orson Welles portrays the titular character, one of the most memorable and important characters from the Shakespearean canon. The story begins with the famous request Lear makes of his daughters: to express how much they love him. In exchange, Lear will divide his land and power amongst them based on the extent of their answers. Cordelia (Natasha Parry), the youngest and the one whom Lear loves the most, answers very modestly -- yet honestly --and incurs the wrath of Lear, who not only withholds his gift to her, but banishes her as well. Lear divides his lands and power between the two older daughters, Goneril (Beatrice Straight) and Regan (Margaret Phillips), who intend to take swift and complete control of their fathers power almost instantaneously. Lear is reduced to an angry, bitter man who realizes too late what has happened. After a series of indignities are inflicted upon him by his daughters, he retreats into a storm, vowing revenge. This film is an above-average adaptation with a very capable cast and a well-staged presentation.

(Chaplin also used the female lead, Georgia Hale, in The Gold Rush.) The Salvation Hunters was a highly unusual film for its era. Its moody cinematography, symbolism, and purposely ugly backgrounds just did not exist in other films (except for Erich von Stroheims Greed). In spite of Chaplins high praise, however, this wasnt a film that audiences of the 1920s found appealing, and nowadays, when von Sternbergs once innovative techniques have become integrated into modern filmmaking, it seems heavy-handed. The story focuses on a boy (George K. Arthur), who is a failure and a coward; a girl (Hale), who is used to the rough life on the riverfront; and a child (Bruce Guerin), whose parents have been killed by the dredge on which the girl lives. In order to ""get away from the mud,"" the boy convinces the girl to take the child and accompany him to the city. There they meet up with the brute (Olaf Hytten), who offers them shelter only because he fancies the girl. The brute takes them out to the country, where he begins to abuse the boy, who finally drops his cowardice and overcomes him in a fight.

William Bradford Huies chronicle of this unfortunate wartime episode, The Execution of Private Slovik, was published in 1954. Frank Sinatra optioned the movie rights for the book, intending to cast Steve McQueen as Slovik and to have blacklisted writer Albert Maltz write the screenplay. The US military reluctantly agreed to okay the film on the proviso that Slovik would not be portrayed sympathetically. Out of deference to his friend John F. Kennedy, Sinatra abandoned the project, and that was that -- until the award-winning TV-writing team of Richard Levinson and William Link became intrigued in the Huie book. After a series of convoluted negotiations, Levinson and Link were finally able to put The Execution of Private Slovik on the small screen on March 13, 1974 (Albert Maltz, upset that the pair had decided upon a strict ""no villains"" policy in their adaptation, washed his hands of the whole affair). Martin Sheen was selected to play Slovik, though for a while Dustin Hoffman was seriously considering taking a cut in salary to essay the role. Abandoning the linear style of Huies book, the writers adopted a Citizen Kane approach, using flashbacks to illustrate the events leading up to the execution. It is made clear throughout the film that no one, neither the military brass nor Slovik himself, truly believed that the private would ever face a firing squad; the usual custom was to postpone the execution until after the war, then reduce the sentence to a long prison term. Thanks to an unfortunate chain of misunderstandings and snafus, Slovik ended up dying by gunfire in a lonely French courtyard -- a fact long withheld from the public (Sloviks wife Antoinette learned of her husbands true fate for the first time from author Huie). The films most famous scene, in which Slovik nervously repeats his ""Hail Marys"" as the hood is being fitted over his head, was Martin Sheens own idea. Filmed on location in California and Canada, The Execution of Private Slovik won a Peabody award for the NBC television network.

Travelling by bus to visit his aunt, Emil loses an envelope of money to sneak thief Grundeis (Heinz Schubert).

This leads to a perilous adventure when it turns out that Grundeis is in league with an erudite master criminal known as The Baron (Walter Slezak), who is planning a major heist. The film waves uncertainly between pure-and-simple kiddie entertainment and a dead-serious ""caper"" effort; surely some of the worldly, cynical dialogue spoken by Walter Slezak went way over the heads of Disneys 8-to-14-year-old target audience.

Ballard laughs off the missive but as he is trying to get into his car, he is abducted by a band of Satanist punks, shot full of heroin, and beaten within an inch of his life. Somehow he escapes from his prison, but when he relates his experiences to the police, they are more inclined to believe that Ballards story is based on drug-induced hallucinations than fact. Later he discovers his girlfriend strung up with barbed wire and an incriminating message written in her blood. Panicked, Ballard flees into the streets where his sanity and his faith in rationality slowly starts to come apart. While being pursued by a slick-skinned demon, Ballard is saved by Benny (Katie Wolfe), a borderline schizophrenic angel of mercy who knows a thing or two about the dark side.

Ladd plays a tough-as-nails Chicago reporter who shows up in a ramshackle south-side boarding house where he wants to interview a runaway and perhaps convince her to go home. He happens into the next room and there finds the tubercular corpse of a young woman. Though her body is ravaged by the disease, she is still incredibly beautiful and he feels strangely drawn to her. Beside her, he finds an address book which he takes before the police arrive. Later he begins looking up addresses in hopes of learning more about her. He soon learns that she was living under an assumed name and had questionable friends, including mobsters, a shifty financier, a bogus writer, a head-injured fighter, a hooker and a moll. As he looks deeper into her relationships with these people he finds himself getting hopelessly entangled in a deadly web of murder and blackmail until the end when he has a violent confrontation with one of the mobsters that culminates in gunplay. The reporter is seriously wounded. Still his obsession with the dead girl seems endless and he even leaves the hospital to attend her funeral. There he burns the address book and as he does, the girls brother concedes that the reporter knew her better than anyone. While the general atmosphere of the film is appropriately grim and gritty, many felt that Ladds reporter was not hopeless enough, and was too inwardly good-hearted to be a true noir anti-hero. Also that the story didnt play up the morbidity of his obsession with the girl coupled with a relatively happy ending helps disqualify it from the noir genre.

(He chose the curved pipe because it allowed him to speak his lines without blocking his mouth.) The virile and magnetic Gillette was one of the most popular performers of his era, but he is mostly forgotten today because his sole motion picture performance -- a 1916 silent adaptation of the play that made him famous - was thought lost to time. But in October 2014, silent film historians rejoiced when a mislabeled French-language nitrate negative was uncovered in Pariss Cinémathèque Française archive - and Sherlock fans were equally jubilant to discover its plot was a faithful adaptation of Gillettes play, with Sherlocks hunt for incriminating documents on behalf of the bewitching Alice Faulkner (Marjorie Kay) thwarted by his sinister nemesis Professor Moriarty (Ernest Maupin).

What the audience knows that Courtney doesnt is that Brand is distraught at losing his men, but is forced by his own superiors to push the pilots beyond their limits. After being accused day after day of being a butcher, Brand takes grim delight in turning over his command to Courtney. Soon Courtney finds himself enduring the ""butcher"" tag, especially after the younger brother of his best friend Scott (David Niven) is killed.

But what was he like before he formed the Nazi party? Screenwriter and director Menno Meyjes explores that question in this drama, a work of fiction keyed to the fact that Hitler unsuccessfully pursued a career as an artist following World War I. In 1918, Max Rothman (John Cusack) is a former artist who lost an arm during the war. While Max can no longer create, his eye for talent is as keen as ever, so he has become a successful art dealer, specializing in Modernists such as George Grosz. Maxs success has brought him a fine home and a beautiful wife, Nina (Molly Parker); hes also acquired a mistress, Liselore (Leelee Sobieski), a lovely young woman with artistic aspirations of her own. One day, Max meets Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor), an emotionally intense, fellow war veteran who has found himself penniless in Munich. Adolf fancies himself an artist, and while Max isnt especially impressed with his technique, he sees in him a burning passion and a desire to communicate, so he encourages Adolf to express his demons through his art. While Adolf takes Maxs advice to heart and strikes up a friendship with him, Maxs friends find Adolfs open advocation of anti-Semitism rather troubling; Max, who is Jewish, simply chalks Adolfs attitudes up to unpleasant wartime experiences. But as Adolf immerses himself more deeply into his political interests and his thoughts on social engineering, he begins to leave painting behind in favor of a more interesting art form, the political arena. Max marked the first directorial effort of noted screenwriter Meyjes.",R (for language),Drama,Menno Meyjes,Lions Gate Films,109 minutes,"John Cusack, Noah Taylor, Leelee Sobieski"

He harbors a secret love for one of his young students, Fran (Beata Tyszkiewicz), whom he loses touch with after her graduation. Some time later, Miereveld has to attend an autopsy, and the shock of the experience deeply affects his mental balance. He finds out -- or he believes so -- that Fran has become a popular singer. He arranges to meet her to finally reveal his feelings.

Using clips of such subjects as the Congo in the early 60s, atomic blasts from 1956, a celebrity visit by Sophia Loren to an eel festival, and exploitation of workers at a Fiat plant - accompanied by a prose poem, authored by Pasolini and then read by him on the soundtrack - Pasolini speaks out against bigotry, intolerance, middle-class hypocrisies, human complacency and a host of other ills that concerned him. His unusual method of juxtaposing unrelated images (and short-circuiting the audiences reactions in this way) anticipates his contributions to Dusan Makavejevs Sweet Movie in the mid-1970s, which employs similar associative techniques but waxes far more shocking. This film incurred a massive amount of trouble almost immediately after it went into production; its original producer, Gastone Ferrante, had the wild and antagonistic idea of turning the project into an episode film, of which Pasolinis segment would constitute 1/2; Ferrante asked the ultra-rightwing ideologue Giovanni Guareschi to do the other half, planning to ""pit"" the two halves against one another in the same program. This, of course, drew ire from Pasolini, who so detested Guareschis philosophies that he wanted nothing to do with the conservative. The picture was nevertheless released as planned, to dismal box office draws, and thereafter disappeared for 45 years. In 2008, a second, ""reconstructed"" version emerged (33 years after Pasolinis murder) and played at the Venice Film Festival, minus the Guareschi elements; retitled La Rabbia di Pasolini, it was supervised by Giuseppe Bertolucci, who receives co-directing credit with Pasolini and does a two-minute filmed introduction.",NR,"Art House & International, Documentary","Pier Paolo Pasolini, Giuseppe Bertolucci",N/A,N/A,"Giuseppe Bertolucci, Pier Paolo Pasolini"

2445,35765,I Am a Camera,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Julie Harris repeats her stage portrayal of the irrepressible Sally Bowles in John Van Drutens I Am a Camera. Set in pre-Hitler Berlin, the film details the curious, chaste relationship between Sally, an entertainer at a bawdy nightclub, and fledgling writer Christopher Isherwood (Lawrence Harvey). Shelley Winters co-stars as Natalia Landauer, whose impending marriage to a wealthy young Jewish man is imperiled by the anti-Semitism which envelops Berlin as the Nazis gain political power. If all this sounds familiar to you, it is because I Am a Camera is the non-musical precursor to the Broadway musical hit Cabaret. Both properties were based on Christopher Isherwoods Berlin Stories. Those familiar with the film version of Cabaret will notice that certain plot elements have been watered down in Camera. Examples: Isherwoods homosexuality is left unmentioned, save for Lawrence Harveys opaque opening comment that he is ""a confirmed bachelor;"" and Sally Bowles third-act abortion is changed into a false-alarm pregnancy. Also, Julie Harris dynamic but rather overbaked interpretation of Sally is not nearly as memorable as Liza Minellis Oscar-winning interpretation of the character in Cabaret. Still, I Am a Camera is well directed and deftly adapted for the screen (by John Collier); and even taking into consideration Ms. Harris hamminess, she remains one of the most fascinating stage personalities of the mid-20th century. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",G,"Classics, Comedy, Drama",Henry Cornelius,N/A,N/A,"Julie Harris, Laurence Harvey, Shelley Winters"

Today the full implications of the crisis in Europe and around the world still remain unclear. Nevertheless, should we accept the crisis as an unfortunate side-effect of the free market? Or is there another explanation as to why it happened and its likely effects on our society, our economy and our whole way of life?

It is as much a political as a psychological question. Wajda, intruding into a private, even intimate sphere of the trade unions leader, attempts to capture the phenomenon of this incredible metamorphosis: from a simple worker, focused on his day-to-day duties, into a charismatic leader. This controversial persona, himself not without flaws, helped millions set free their dreams of freedom theyd been hiding deep in their hearts, setting the stage for transformations beyond anyones imagination at the time. And yet, Wałęsas story does not only have this one psychological or local dimension. It is embedded in the context of international politics. The life of a simple electrician, at first fighting for his fellow workers rights, only echoes some remote events, until it is Wałęsa himself and millions of his fellow countrywomen and men that become world news for several years to come. This historical perspective, combined with a dynamic story of daily life in the Polish Peoples Republic, should help comprehend the phenomenon of those transformations. The film is mainly addressed to young people, at the same time constituting a reminder of an outstanding filmmaker.

Blake, on his horse ""Stardusk"" (!), obtains a job on the ranch belonging to Watson (Spencer Williams of Amos n Andy fame). Meanwhile, a neighbor, Dennison (Leonard Christmas), is threatened by Bradley (Clarence Brooks) and his thug Connors (Tom Southern) who want to get their hands of the mans secret radium mine. Leaving Dennison for dead, Bradley schemes to kidnap his daughter Margaret (Artie Young), who is arriving with $6,000 for the mortgage and presumably knows where the secret mine is located. The talkative Connors is killed by his boss, who puts the blame on Blake. Arrested by the sheriff (Wade Dumas), Blake uses his dexterity to break out of jail and arrives just in time to save Margaret from Bradley and his gang. Returning to the Dennison spread, Blake and his sidekick Dusty (Lucius Brooks) find the owner, who has stayed alive by hiding in his underground mine. Jeffries, whose singing was better than his acting, warbled his own Im a Happy Cowboy (over the opening credits) and Prairie Flower, the latter accompanied by the singing group The Four Tones.

On the homefront, Gotham also takes a closer look at the expansive spiritual empire his father has built over his 25 year career that initially was conceived out of Deepaks own deep personal and spiritual dissatisfaction, and a decidedly non-spiritual (and boozy) origin. -- (C) Official Site",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest, Faith & Spirituality",Gotham Chopra,Independent Pictures,83 minutes,"Deepak Chopra, Gotham Chopra, Rita Chopra"

After creation, we are introduced to the buff-naked Adam and Eve (Michael Parks and Ulla Bergyd), whose fall from grace segues into the Cain and Abel story. Next on the docket is the story of Noah, played by director Huston, whod originally wanted Charlie Chaplin for the role. Abrahams sacrifice is then dramatized, with George C. Scott as the beleaguered protagonist. In quick succession, we are offered the Tower of Babel, the defiance of Nimrod, and Sodom and Gomorroh.

Set in the wake of the destruction of Troy, Lion of Thebes tells of Helens flight from the vengeance of the Greeks, in the company of her loyal protector Arion (Mark Forest). She falls into the hands of the pharaoh Ramses, who sits on the throne of Thebes and is opposed by the aging pharaoh Menophis. Ramses plans to marry Helen, but he is murdered by his jealous councilor. Arion must save her life when she is accused of the murder and sentenced to death. The plot intricacies intersect with elements of Land of the Pharaohs, with its court intrigue and treachery, but the presence of Forest adds an element of excitement to go with the exoticism of the settings and story, with his taciturn demeanor and always-at-the-ready muscleman heroics.
