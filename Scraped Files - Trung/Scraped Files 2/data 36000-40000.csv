Premised on the idea of ""Free Land for Free People,"" and financed by the largesse of Hollywood celebrities, the founders of Black Bear bought land deep in the wilderness and raised a rough-hewn homestead. Over the years, hundreds would join the community, and life would be complicated by conflicts about the role of women, child-rearing, proper communalist behavior, the FBI and, most traumatically, a child-snatching cult.

The story focuses on Haru, a thoroughly bored music producer who justifiably fears that he might literally disappear into thin air; and Michi, an employee at an international mail carrier, who likes to decorate her apartment with stolen items and fantasizes about going to foreign lands. Listless and prone to violent fantasies -- his of gang war, hers of suicide -- the couple volunteers to be test subjects for a new experimental drug designed to combat the effects of the pollen, even though the side effects render them sterile. Within this vague and insecure world, the two try to maintain their love but find themselves drifting apart. Every half-thought attempt at salvaging their relationship only results in further alienation. Haru buys a dog but eventually he gives it away, putting further strain on the two. The couple attempts to flee their everyday existence and visit the sea, when they happen upon a washed-up skeleton. The emotional fallout finally results in the relationships breaking up. Later, they meet again in a most surprising fashion. Kurosawas film, told largely with long takes and a minimum of dialog, reads like an ironic reworking of alienated youth dramas. These characters are so internally inert and emotionally cut off that they seem to verge on the darkly comic; yet their love for one another keeps them from sliding into the abyss. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Kiyoshi Kurosawa,N/A,N/A,"Shinji Takeda, Yutaka Yasui, Masamichi Matsumoto"

When the plant begins malfunctioning, the towns leaders summon the designer, David Harrison (Jim Metzler), to look into the problem. Soon after Harrison and his wife Sarah (Morgan Brittany) arrive, however, they find themselves in the thick of an escalating rivalry between two vampire factions -- one led by peaceful Count Mardulak (David Carradine), who ordered the blood plant as part of his plan to integrate the dying vampire race into human society; and the old-school bloodsuckers, under the sinister Jefferson (John Ireland), who consider Mardulak and his followers traitors to their predatory heritage. While the Harrisons fates hang in the balance, the scales are jostled further by the arrival of a man named Van Helsing (Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell, in a surprisingly low-key performance), descendant of the legendary vampire hunter, whose disorganized efforts at wiping out towns undead populace are impeded by his growing attraction to a pretty young vampire (Deborah Foreman). With tongue firmly in cheek, this semi-parody plays off audiences familiarity with the conventions of the vampire genre, but it seldom sacrifices creepiness and suspense when needed.

As a result, various Rashevski begin some rather intense periods of spiritual introspection, ranging from Rosas granddaughter Ninas (Tania Gabarski, daughter of the director) proclamation to start and raise a Jewish family to grandson -- and former Israeli military man -- Ricas (Rudi Rosenberg) turbulent relationship with his Muslim girlfriend, Khadija (Selma Kouchy). To further complicate matters, a non-Jewish family friend named Antoine (Hippolyte Girardot) shows up at the funeral and strikes up a conversation with Nina, whom he used to baby-sit when they were both younger.

However, when Yeremey returns, he learns to his surprise that he has just become a father; terrified that his newborn son will be handed over to Chudo-Yudo, the Tsar makes a secret arrangement with a poor fisherman to exchange babies to keep his child from Chudo-Yudos clutches. As the children grow to be men, Yeremey pays little attention to pudgy and self-centered Prince Andrei (Sergei Nikolayev), while from a distance he dotes on the strapping fishermans boy Andrei (Andrei Katyshev); what the Tsar doesnt realize, however, is that there was a mix-up in the exchange of babies, and that his true son has been living with him all along.

The story concerns the machinations of evil millionaire Artigas (Miloslav Holub), who plans to use a super-explosive device to conquer the world. Artigas operates from a pirate submarine, wherein he has imprisoned the explosives inventor, Professor Roche (Arnost Navratil). One of the ships destroyed by the pirate sub includes among its passengers the scientists daughter Jana (Jana Zatloukalova), who is rescued and spirited away to Artigas headquarters inside an enormous volcano. Here Jana falls in love with Simon Hart (Lubor Tokos), Roches assistant, whod been abducted along with the Professor. Jana and Simon plan to escape the volcano in Artigas observation balloon. Professor Roche, who foolishly believes that Artigas is a humanitarian, stays behind, but when he discovers Artigas plans he sets off the explosive himself. The volcano is destroyed as Jana and Simons balloon floats into the sunset. Fabulous World of Jules Verne is brilliantly filmed in a special process which causes every image on screen to resemble an old-fashioned woodcut engraving, replete with forced-perspective sets and props. The films deliberately unrealistic visual texture, coupled with the slightly satirical, larger-than-life performances of the cast, make the delightful Fabulous World appear to be a 19th century ""futuristic"" novel come to life.

The story shows what happens when a highly cultured group of musicians from a string quartet spend the summer rehearsing in a small village in the Georgian countryside.

Claudiu Crulic was a small-time salesman who specialized in buying discounted products in Poland and selling them at a profit in his native Romania.

However, Crulic insisted he was in Italy on the day of the theft, and he had train tickets, passenger lists, and other evidence to prove it. Despite this, Crulics pleas to both Romanian and Polish officials fell on deaf ears, and as he became increasingly frustrated that no one was willing to intervene on his behalf. In protest, Crulic went on a hunger strike; the prison staffs response to Crulics defiance was inept and ill advised, and belated efforts to force-feed the prisoner led to Crulics death at the age of 33. Using a variety of artistic styles and animation formats, Crulic: Drumul Spre Dincolo (aka Crulic: The Path To Beyond) visualizes Crulics true story, presenting a case for his innocence and recounting the arrogance, poor judgment, and medical failings which led to a premature death that could have easily been prevented.

The opening shot, in which what appears to be a room is only a set, is strikingly similar to a scene in 1921s The Playhouse. A later gag, where a piece of scenery falls onto Arbuckle, framing him in its second-story window, is repeated on a much, much grander scale in Keatons 1928 feature Steamboat Bill, Jr. On the other hand, Arbuckle borrowed from Keaton, too -- at one point during the stage show, he throws Keaton at a heckler.

Caroline Link won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language film with Nowhere in Africa, a tale of German migrants far away from home in Kenya. In Exit Marrakech she once again transplants her characters to a hotter, more unpredictable locale, this time telling a contemporary story of young wanderlust. Heinrich (Ulrich Tukur) is an acclaimed German stage director invited to Morocco to participate in an international theatre festival. The arrival of his seventeen-year-old son Ben (Samuel Schneider) presents an opportunity for family bonding in a fresh environment, but old grievances quickly resurface. Ben soon leaves behind his fathers luxury hotel to explore Morocco on his own. In the way of so many young men of privilege, he is inevitably drawn to a girl from a poorer, less coddled background (the terrific Hafsia Herzi from The Secret of the Grain). Ben follows Karima back to her Berber village, falling completely out of touch with his father and with the security he has always known. Links sensitivity to the emotional triggers that exist between parents and children helps to anchor the story in the familiar, while her keen eye for Moroccos natural beauty bathes our senses in wonderment, whether through breathtaking vistas of mountains and deserts or stylish shots of journeys by skateboard through the densely populated city. Like a fresher, contemporary Paul Bowles story, Exit Marrakech offers a glimpse of what can happen when a Westerner is confronted with the radically unfamiliar.

At first glance, the film seems to be a horror picture, as satanic potato farmer Grimes (Gustav Von Seyfertitz) crushes a childs doll with his thumb and forefinger and tosses the plaything into the dismal swamps surrounding his lands. We learn that Grimes has been exploiting the children from a local orphanage, forcing them to work his farm day and night. Though collecting a hefty maintenance pay for the orphans, Grimes dresses them in rags and feeds them a starvation diet. Happily, Mary Pickford, the oldest of the orphans, has enough gumption to stand up to Grimes and prohibit him from inflicting any further atrocities. The plot thickens when a kidnaped child is left in Grimes care in exchange for a generous portion of the ransom money. Mary rescues the abducted child, as well as all the other orphans, by leading them through the alligator-infested and quicksand-festooned swamp--a truly frightening sequence, made even more so by the use of real gators.

One day, while spiriting a beautiful fare to her destination, the passengers purse is snatched by a pint-sized cutpurse. Determined to rescue the womans valuables, Amal gives chase to the little girl, who is stricken by a car after ducking into traffic. While Amal dutifully rushes the girl to the hospital and agrees to pay her medical bills, he realizes that he cannot afford the expense. But there is hope for both Amal and the injured young thief, because the fare that the rickshaw driver allowed to walk free was in fact an eccentric millionaire named G.K. Jayaram (Naseeruddin Shah). At the time Amal picked G.K. up, the ageing family patriarch was growing increasingly perturbed with his grasping children - all of whom seemed to hear a cash register ringing when their father fell ill. In one final act of anonymous generosity, G.K. bestowed Amal his entire fortune. But the executor of G.K.s estate has only thirty days to find one common rickshaw driver in a bustling city of 14 million, otherwise the money reverts back to the millionaires rightful family. While its plain to see who would benefit from the money the most, the prospect of the estate executer actually locating Amal is growing slimmer with each passing day and G.K.s greedy family is willing to get downright vicious in order to claim the inheritance as their own.",NR,"Art House & International, Drama",Richie Mehta,Séville Pictures,101 minutes,"Koel Purie, Naseeruddin Shah, Rupinder Nagra"

A group of foreign diplomats led by White plan to get the formula from the Professor by either bribe or theft. When he is ejected from the house by the butler at the Colonels request, Leo hires a thief to do the dirty work, but is overheard by a cop.

A riot starts at the flophouse when Charlie robs a pickpocket who has been robbing the sleepers. Chaplin uses a gag he was to repeat in The Gold Rush, that of laying covered in bed, wrong way round, with hands in shoes. The thief, having co-opted Charlie, arrives at the Nutt house and tries to steal the formula, but the cops are there and a melee ensues in which the thief fires his gun into the Colonels invention and the house, the diplomats and everyone else explodes.

The brothers began inviting ""chancy"" performers onto their series, among them the long-blacklisted Pete Seeger and singer-activist Joan Baez. Not surprisingly, the hidebound CBS executives balked at the series incessant anti-establishment message, and the brothers found themselves at the mercy of the network censors. Thus began a well-publicized ""David and Goliath"" battle between the Smothers boys and the ""Big Eye"" network, culminating in the abrupt cancellation of The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in mid-1969.

In this story, nine men are being held prisoner by the army along the front lines. Three of them are ordinary ""honest"" thieves, one was caught spying, another poisoning, the third was accused of collaborating with the enemy because he alone survived when his unit was wiped out and the remaining three deserted from their units.

Ostensibly a portrait of photographer Denise Bellon, focusing on the two decades between 1935 and 1955, the film leaps and backtracks, Marker-style, from subject to subject, from a family portrait of Bellon and her two daughters, Loleh and Yannick (the latter co-authored the film), to a wide-ranging history of surrealism, of the city of Paris, of French cinema and the birth of the cin (C)mathque, of Europe, the National Front, the Second World War and Spanish Civil War, and postwar politics and culture.Full of Marker jokes (a great one about artists and cats), word play (Citroen/citron), filmic homages (Musidora makes a memorable appearance), peculiar art history, a consideration of the 1952 Olympics, and astounding segues from French colonialism in Africa to women in the Maghreb, to a Jewish wedding and gypsy culture in Europe, to Mein Kampf and the Nazi death camps (Birkenau, Auschwitz), the film opens with Dali and ends with Mompou, traversing in its short time a world of thought, feeling, and history.A small masterpiece of montage, REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS TO COME is from moment to moment reminiscent of Resnais, Ivens, even Kubrick, but in its deployment of still photographs (as in La Jet (C)e), its theme of history and memory, its subject-skipping montage and rapid shuttle of wit and philosophy, REMEMBRANCE is pure, marvelous Marker. -- © First Run/Icarus Films",NR,"Documentary, Drama, Special Interest","Chris Marker, Yannick Bellon, Chris Marker & Yannick Bellon",First Run/Icarus Films,91 minutes,Pierre Arditi

Three young, self-styled white supremists overpower a 49-year-old black man named James Byrd Jr., chain him to the back of their pickup, and literally drag him to death. What follows is a media firestorm, exacerbated by scores of network and cable-TV news services, the grim pronouncements of so-called pundits, and the intrusion upon Jasper of several extremist activists, ranging from members of the Ku Klux Klan to the newly formed Black Panthers. As the frenzy continues, the heretofore peaceful, if somewhat tenuous, relationship between the white and black residents of Jasper is severely strained, with echoes of past racism resounding throughout the area. In the center of the controversy are two decent, hard-working public servants: R.C. Horn, the first black mayor of Jasper, and Billy Rowles, the towns white sheriff. Also profoundly affected by the appalling murder of Byrd are the respective parents of the victim and the killers. Happily, when the dust clears, justice is done (two of the murderers are condemned to death, the third sentenced to life imprisonment), and, instead of being wrenched apart, the black and white communities of Jasper draw closer together than they have ever been. Made for cable TV, this feature-length reenactment stars Louis Gossett Jr. as Horn and Jon Voight as Rowles. Although certain liberties are taken (the actor playing Byrd is clearly much younger than his real-life counterpart and the Black Panthers and KKK are incorrectly shown descending upon Jasper the same day), the film is, by and large, accurate. Better still, there is a minimum of preaching and proselytizing.

The boys are drawn, along with the children from the other families, to a lonely cave near the beach, where an alien presence, in the form of a huge (and ever-growing) brain, has hidden itself. At first, it uses the children to try and persuade the more reasonable of the parents that their project -- a missile called The Thunderer, which will place a hydrogen bomb in orbit, capable of being used on any target in the event the United States is threatened -- is too dangerous to complete. But the parents arent prepared to listen, either because they dont understand the danger, or because they genuinely believe in the conduct of the Cold War, as in the case of Hank Johnson (Jackie Coogan); or because theyre too angry and belligerent, like Joe Gamble (Russell Johnson), who is at a dead-end in his job and has taken to alcoholism and abusing his wife (Jean Engstrom) and stepson (Johnny Washbrook). As the launch approaches and the childrens entreaties are ignored, the alien takes more direct action with their help, and they soon find a potential ally in in Dr. Wahrman (Raymond Bailey), the inventor of The Thunderer, who is also the only man on the project smart enough to realize that he may not have all the answers.

Mathilda doesnt much care for her parents, but she has a close bond with her four-year-old brother. One day, she returns from running an errand to discover that most of her family, including her brother, have been killed in a raid by corrupt DEA agents, led by the psychotic Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Mathilda takes refuge in the apartment of her secretive neighbor, Leon (Jean Reno), who takes her in with a certain reluctance. She discovers that Leon is a professional assassin, working for Tony (Danny Aiello), a mob kingpin based in Little Italy. Wanting to avenge the death of her brother, Mathilda makes a deal with Leon to become his protégée in exchange for work as a domestic servant, hoping to learn the hitmans trade and take out the men who took her brothers life. However, an affection develops between Leon and Mathilda that changes his outlook on his life and career. Bessons first American film boasted a strong performance from Jean Reno, a striking debut by Natalie Portman, and a love-it-or-hate-it, over-the-top turn by Gary Oldman. Léon was originally released in the U.S. in 1994 as The Professional, with 26 minutes cut in response to audience preview tests. Those 26 minutes were restored in the directors preferred cut, released in 1996 in France as Léon: Version Intégrale and in the U.S. on DVD as Léon: The Professional in 2000. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi","R (for scenes of strong graphic violence, and for language)","Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Luc Besson,Columbia Pictures,104 minutes,"Jean Reno, Gary Oldman, Natalie Portman"

He joins a communist cell, but finds he is woefully out of place. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Cserhalmis political viewpoint is governed almost exclusively by his vacillating emotions. The film is enhanced with a ""Russian Roulette"" leitmotif, not unlike the fatalistic throughline of Michael Ciminos The Deer Hunter. Director Jancso followed Hungarian Rhapsody with Allegro Barbaro; both films were originally released in tandem, then redistributed as separate features. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Drama","Gyula Hernadi, Miklós Jancsó",N/A,N/A,"György Cserhalmi, Lajos Balazsovits, Gábor Koncz"

There are few characters she hated more than Pollyanna, the ""glad girl,"" but she knew that her fans would show up in droves to see this picture, which was based on Eleanor Porters novel. So she gritted her teeth, and at the worldly age of 27, dove into the role of the eternally cheerful 12-year-old orphan girl. After the death of her father (J. Wharton James), Pollyanna goes to live with her crotchety aunt Polly Harrington (Katherine Griffith). Her father taught her to be happy at all times, and Pollyanna spreads this saccharine philosophy throughout the New England village where she now lives. The richest man in town adores little Pollyanna, and obligingly adopts the girls favorite playmate, a little orphan boy. Even when Pollyanna is hurt while saving a child from an onrushing car, her happy demeanor never fades. The doctor (Herbert Prior) who attends her is her maiden aunts old suitor, and they are brought together once more as Pollyanna learns how to walk again. Pickfords favorite scene was the one moment when Pollyanna gives full reign to out-and-out naughtiness. Pollyanna captures a fly and sweetly asks it if it would like to go to heaven. Assuming the answer to be yes, she smashes the insect and beams, ""Well, you have!"" Incidentally, this scene was not in the Porter book; most likely it came straight from the stars active mind.

The film begins its journey inside a Texas prison, after these women have spent nearly a decade behind bars. They were 19 and 20 years at the time that allegations surfaced. Using the womens home video footage from 21 years ago combined with recent verité footage and interviews, the film explores their personal narratives and their search for exculpatory evidence to help their losing criminal trials. 15 years into their journey, director Deborah S. Esquenazi captures an on-camera recantation by one of the initial outcry victims, now 25 years old although 7 at the time of the investigation.

Helming new legislation, this is the first case in U.S. history that allows wrongfully convicted innocents to challenge convictions based on Junk Science, or debunked forensics. As lesbian low income women of color, these women hold intersecting identities that make them the most vulnerable to incarceration and juror bias. This under-reported injustice is actually widespread: Latina women represent one of the growing populations heading into prison.

Set in a hellish vision of a New York-like city, where it is always raining and the air crackles with impending death, the film concerns Det. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a homicide specialist just one week from a well-deserved retirement. Every minute of his 32 years on the job is evident in Somersets worn, exhausted face, and his soul aches with the pain that can only come from having seen and felt far too much. But Somersets retirement must wait for one last case, for which he is teamed with young hotshot David Mills (Brad Pitt), the fiery detective set to replace him at the end of the week. Mills has talked his reluctant wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), into moving to the big city so that he can tackle important cases, but his first and Somersets last are more than either man has bargained for. A diabolical serial killer is staging grisly murders, choosing victims representing the seven deadly sins. First, an obese man is forced to eat until his stomach ruptures to represent gluttony, then a wealthy defense lawyer is made to cut off a pound of his own flesh as penance for greed. Somerset initially refuses to take the case, realizing that there will be five more murders, ghastly sermons about lust, sloth, pride, wrath, and envy presented by a madman to a sinful world. Somerset is correct, and something within him cannot let the case go, forcing the weary detective to team with Mills and see the case to its almost unspeakably horrible conclusion. The moody photography is by Darius Khondji; the nauseatingly vivid special effects are by makeup artist Rob Bottin, best known for more fantasy-oriented work in films like The Howling (1981). ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi",R,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense",David Fincher,New Line Cinema,130 minutes,"Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow"

The cop, upon seeing his own wallet, decides to leave Stan, Ollie and their unpaid bill to the mercy of the brutal restaurant manager and his thug-like employees. The lights of the establishment go off, but the crashes make what is going on all too clear. The beating ends up with Ollie being thrown in the street, where a truck narrowly misses him, while Stan is dumped in a rain barrel. Ollie goes to look for Stan, and finds him in the rain barrel, where he has drunk all the water. One of Below Zeros jokes is very much of its era: Kay Deslys refers to Ollie as ""Mr. Whiteman"" -- thats a reference to bandleader Paul Whiteman, who was a dead ringer for Hardy.

Ray spots would-be bank teller Claude Banks (Martin Lawrence) at a gambling spot and, figuring him for an easy mark, lifts his wallet -- only to discover Claude is broke. Ray and Claudes mutual need to raise some cash brings them together when Spanky offers them a job bringing back a load of moonshine from bootleggers in the deep south. However, things dont go well for Ray and Claude, and theyre arrested by a sheriff in Mississippi who recently killed a man and needs someone on whom he can hang the charge. Since Ray and Claude are black, from out of town and have been caught red-handed with a load of illegal liquor, the sheriff figures theyre easy pickings and frames them for the murder. Soon the two men are inmates in a Southern work camp, where they spend the next 55 years learning to get along with the other inmates, avoiding the wrath of the guards, seeing younger prisoners come and go and never losing hope that someday, somehow, their innocence will be proven and theyll be released. Life is the second screen pairing for Murphy and Lawrence, who also shared screen time in 1992s Boomerang, and was scripted by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone from an original idea by Murphy.

2001,39310,The Plainsman,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"One is immediately aware that The Plainsman is a Cecil B. DeMille production in the opening scene, wherein President Abraham Lincoln (Frank McGlynn Sr.), on the verge of signing crucial legislation which will determine the future of the American West, is dragged away from his Cabinet by a scolding Mrs. Lincoln (Leila McIntyre), who informs her husband that hell be late for the theater! The story proper picks up in the years just following the Civil War, as crooked arms dealer John Lattimer (Charles Bickford) schemes to sell a huge shipment of repeating rifles to the Indians. Constantly thwarting Lattimers schemes is lawman Wild Bill Hickok (Gary Cooper), who soon forms a strong alliance with Indian scout Buffalo Bill Cody (James Ellison). Rambunctious Calamity Jane (Jean Arthur) is crazy about Wild Bill, but he refuses to have anything to do with her, contemptuously wiping his mouth whenever he kisses her. He prefers the company of winsome Louisa (Dorothy Burgess), but gallantly steps aside when Louisa marries Buffalo Bill. Upon learning that a band of Indians armed with Lattimers rifles have attacked a military garrison, Wild Bill tells General Custer (John Miljan), who in turn sends Buffalo Bill to the garrison with a consignment of weapons. Wild Bill then tries to arrange a peace conference with Indian chief Yellow Hand (Paul Harvey), but is sidetracked when he sees Calamity Jane being captured by two Indian braves. Riding to her rescue, Wild Bill is himself captured and tortured in the hope that hell reveal the whereabouts of Buffalo Bill and his weapons. He refuses to talk, but Calamity, horrified at the agony endured by Wild Bill, tells all. Her breach of confidence leads indirectly to Custers death at the Little Big Horn (not seen, but described by a young Indian played by DeMilles then son-in-law Anthony Quinn), whereupon Wild Bill disgustedly breaks off all communication with her. Hoping to make up for her past sins, Calamity warns Wild Bill that Lattimer has come to town a-gunning for him. Wild Bill makes short work of Lattimer, only to be shot in the back by the villains snivelling confederate Jack McCall (Porter Hall). As he breathes his last, Wild Bill forgives Calamity for revealing the whereabouts of the ammunition; with tears in her eyes, Calamity plants a kiss on Wild Bills lips that hell never wipe off. As can be seen, accuracy is not the strong suit of The Plainsman; DeMille, like Buffalo Bill before him, was more interested in putting on a helluva good show than offering a dry history lesson. Unfortunately, the film often promises more than it can deliver, thanks to DeMilles insistence upon filming more of his big scenes indoors and relying far too heavily on grainy process screens. Still, the DeMille version of The Plainsman is infinitely more entertaining than the 1966 remake with Don Murray and Abby Dalton.",NR,"Classics, Drama, Western, Romance",Cecil B.

But when Islamic hardliners took control of northern Mali in 2012, they enforced one of the harshest interpretations of sharia law in history and, crucially for Mali, they banned all forms of music. Radio stations were destroyed, instruments burned and Malis musicians faced torture, even death. Overnight, Malis revered musicians were forced into hiding or exile where most remain even now. But rather than lay down their instruments, the musicians are fighting back, standing up for their cultural heritage and identity. Through everything, they have used music as their weapon against the on-going violence that has left Mali ravaged. They Will Have To Kill Us First begins with musicians on the run, reveals footage of the jihadists, captures life at refugee camps, follows perilous journeys home to battle scarred cities, and witnesses our two female characters perform at the first public concert in Timbuktu since the music ban. The stories of these artists are told without gloss - they are sometimes heartbreaking, sometimes inspirational, and sometimes incredibly frustrating as we watch musicians make tough choices about their futures. The situation in Mali forms part of an alarming trend: across the globe, extremists are attacking culture, art and freedom with increasing frequency and violence. They use religion to justify rampant destruction and murder. They Will Have To Kill Us First draws audiences into the human side of Malis conflict, watches events as they unfold and witnesses the impact on Malis musical community. With a specially commissioned soundtrack from Malis most exciting artists, a score written by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs Nick Zinner, They Will Have To Kill Us First leaps headfirst into a tale of courage in the face of conflict.",NR,Documentary,Johanna Schwartz,Mojo Music,105 minutes,"Khaira Arby, Fadimata Walet Oumar, Moussa Sidi"

Murphy plays Tom Destry, the peace-loving son of a notorious gunslinger. Destry is summoned to a wide-open western town in hopes that he can stem the villainies of saloon owner Decker (Lyle Bettger) and crooked mayor Sellers (Edgar Buchanan).

Mari Blanchard essays the Marlene Dietrich role as vacillating saloon-hall chirp Brandy, while Lori Nelson is the ""good""girl with whom Destry ultimately settles down. Though most of the highlights of Destry -- including the all-girl saloon brawl -- are lifted bodily from 1939s Destry Rides Again, the 1954 film lacks the light touch of the earlier picture, despite the fact that comedy craftsman George Marshall directed both pictures. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",NR,"Action & Adventure, Western",George Marshall,Universal Pictures,95 minutes,"Audie Murphy, Mari Blanchard, Lyle Bettger"

Andre Braugher (who also executive produced) stars as legendary African-American labor organizer Asa Philip Randolph. The story begins in the 1920s, a time when being a railway Pullman-car porter was one of the few jobs open to black men. It was bad enough that the job paid starvation wages for impossibly long hours; even worse was the fact that white train passengers were encouraged to patronizingly refer to each and every black porter as ""George,"" in honor of sleeping-berth maven George Pullman. After the death of a young porter whod saved the life of a white passenger, coupled with his own humiliating experiences in a porters uniform, Asa Philip Randolph agrees to help organize the porters into a union -- a task at which he has already failed in six previous instances with six different occupations. Although Randolph has strong support from friends, family, and a handful of white political activists, his mission may well be doomed from the start, thanks to the brutal strikebreaking tactics of Pullman Company head Barton Davis (Kenneth McGregor) and Davis legions of paid hooligans and bought-off politicians. In fact, it would be 12 years before Randolphs union would finally see the light at the end of the tunnel -- and even then there would be rough roads ahead. Also in the cast are Mario Van Peeples and Charles S.

Awarded the Grand Jury Prize at Berlin, An Episode in the Life of an Iron Picker is a story of courage in the face of hardship and injustice. It revisits the alarming saga of Senada Alimanović and partner Nazif Mujić (recipient of the Berlin Silver Bear for best actor for his autobiographical portrayal). Struggling to make ends meet as a scrap-metal forager in the remote Roma community of Poljice, Nazifs hardscrabble routine becomes a desperate fight for survival when Senada suffers a miscarriage. Without medical insurance or means to pay for a life-saving antisepsis procedure, Senada and Nazif are denied admittance to the local hospital. So begins a hellish ten-day odyssey pitting the couple against social prejudice and a callous bureaucracy, as Nazif scrounges and Senadas condition grows ever more critical. From these wrenching events, Tanović fashions an unflinching exposé of the institutional discrimination faced by Bosnia- Herzegovinas Roma minority. Shot with an unvarnished, verité aesthetic against the bleak backdrop of the Bosnian winter, his film treats its subject with great compassion, providing an intimate, empathetic portrait of dignity amid crisis. His non-professional performers, meanwhile, lend the project a compelling authenticity. The knowledge that they are reliving their own nightmarish memories only bolsters the emotional potency of Tanovićs pointed social critique.

2221,39628,Lights of New York,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Contrary to popular belief, no one speaks into microphones hidden in vases in this, the first 100% ""all-talking"" feature film, although an oversized telephone prop is rather conveniently placed near the actors in one long sequence. Although not nearly as crude as its tattered reputation, Lights of New York is far from thrilling, however. Not so much due to the later so maligned sound-on-disc Vitaphone system, but mainly because this was really a quickie B-Movie helmed by a first time director, Bryan Foy, who seems to have been little more than an inefficient traffic cop. Not that there is all that much traffic in this stage-bound melodrama about Eddie (Cullen Landis), a young kid from Upstate New York conned into fronting for a speakeasy on Broadway. There is the inevitable chorus-girl with a heart of gold (top-billed Helene Costello), the downtrodden floozy (Gladys Brockwell), and a cop-killing gangster boss, Hawk Miller (Wheeler Oakman), whom screenwriters Hugh Herbert and Murray Roth furnished with the films one memorable line. With the cops closing in on him, Hawk needs a patsy. Planting contraband in poor Eddies shop, the gang leader then instructs his henchmen to ""take. . .him. . .for. . .a. . .ride!"" Oakman speaks this much parodied line slowly and in a stentorian manner, lest the audience should fail to understand the grave implications. But Eddie escapes his ""ride,"" and there is a final confrontation. Just as all hope seems lost, Hawk is killed by persons unknown. The murder weapon, however, belongs to the chorus girl and she is about to be arrested by no-nonsense Detective Crosby (Robert Elliott), when the real murderer -- the downtrodden floozy -- gives herself up. The performances in this historic talking picture run the gamut from inept (Costello, Landis) to over-the-top (Brockwell) to adequate (Oakman, comic sidekick Eugene Palette). Perhaps due to the newness of it all, the actors keep flubbing their line -- the poor Miss Costello being the worst offender, with Tom Dugan, a veteran supporting player, a close second. Why Warner Bros. should have chosen this pedestrian gangster melodrama as the first full-length talking picture remains a mystery. The best explanation is that the studio was merely testing the waters. Rather than a prestige project like the previous years groundbreaking part-talkie The Jazz Singer, Lights of New York was produced for a paltry $23,000 and released not on a reserved-seat basis but in a mere grind house. But to everyones surprise, the film went on to gross over a million dollars in its first run, proving once and for all that talkies had come to stay. Today, Lights of New York remains a museum piece but despite its tattered reputation, the gangster melodrama is really no worse than the majority of low-budget early talkies. ~ Hans J.

One version has Jeffreys hanged, then taken down and beheaded, while another has him watching a hanging from a window while a narrator reads his death sentence. There is also a third ending in which Jeffreys makes a confession to Harrys father, the Earl of Wessex (Leo Genn), before suffering a fatal heart attack. Franco used the character again, this time portrayed by Cihangir Gaffari (aka John Foster) in his 1972 film Les Demons.

2233,39646,Sherlock Holmes: Incident at Victoria Falls,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Four countries--Great Britain, Belgium, Italy and Luxembourg--were in on the financing of 1991s Sherlock Holmes: Incident at Victoria Falls. At first glance, Christopher Lee seems too old to play Conan Doyles master detective, but the script allows for this by having the story takes place on the eve of Holmes retirement. As Dr. Watson, Patrick McNee returns to the ""comic relief"" mode established in the 1940s by Nigel Bruce, albeit with less empty-headedness than was customary with Bruce. The plot concerns the safe passage of a valuable South African diamond, and the multitude of robberies, recoveries and major and minor intrigues the transpire before the denouement at the titular falls. To establish time and place, King Edward VI (Joss Ackland) and Teddy Roosevelt (Claude Akins) make brief appearances. When originally presented on European television, Incident at Victoria Falls was a four-hour miniseries, with Jenny Seagrove appearing in a sizeable role. For its American syndicated-TV bow in 1992, the film was somewhat clumsily chopped down to two hours, and Seagroves part was eliminated (though her name still appears in the opening and closing credits). Incident at Victoria Falls is strongest in its elegant ambience and attention to detail; it is least successful in its ham-handed comic interludes. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",G,"Action & Adventure, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Television",Bill Corcoran,Vestron Video,100 minutes,"Christopher Lee, Jenny Seagrove, Claude Akins"

The ""five"" of the title are the only survivors of a nuclear disaster, all of whom have rather illogically converged in this house. William Phipps, the hero, was left untouched by the explosion because hed been alone in an Empire State Building elevator! He is the first to arrive at the house, and is joined in quick succession by a pregnant woman (Susan Douglas), a fascistic soldier of fortune (James Anderson), an African American doorman (Charles Lampkin) and a shell-shocked bank clerk (Earl Lee). The clerk mercifully dies of radiation early on, leaving the remaining four to converse at great and boring length on all things philosophical. At long, long last, only the hero and the woman are left alive to do the ""Adam and Eve"" bit. Though Arch Oboler was one of the greatest radio writers of all time, Five proves that he was in over his head as a filmmaker; the dialogue evokes laughter rather than profound thought, and the plotline has logic holes big enough to drive trucks through.",NR,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama, Horror, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Arch Oboler,Sony Pictures Entertainment,93 minutes,"William Phipps, Susan Douglas Rubes, James Anderson"
