Only then does Blume realize that he cant live without Nina, even though she seems fine without him, and he has a new sex partner in divorcÃ©e Arlene (Marsha Mason).

In a desperate attempt to retain some self-respect and dignity, the cook plots to rob a bank. Just before he strides through the banks sliding glass doors, however, he realizes that he forgot one crucial thing -- a gauze face mask (often worn when one has a cold in Japan). He hurries to a nearby convenience store, only to find that it only stocks one in a childs size. Realizing that he also forgot his wallet, the increasingly panicky Yasuda pockets the mask, only to get caught in the act by a store clerk named Aikawa (Diamond Yukai) -- a crank-addicted rock singer whose career is rapidly going south. A tussle ensues, resulting in Yasuda winging the clerk in the arm. Completely terrified, the would-be bank robber drops his gun and flees the store, with Aikawa chasing after him looking for blood. Just as he is about to squeeze off a round at Yasudas head, the clerk runs smack into Takeda (Shinichi Tsutsumi), a third-rate yazuka to whom Aikawa owes a stack of money and who inadvertently started a gang war through his own cowardice.

And the undisputed center of American - some would say international - art and film was New York City. In particular, downtown Manhattan in the late 1970s and 80s was the anchor of vanguard filmmaking.

Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemarys reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast, the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castevets circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth, and the baby is taken away from her.

This apocalyptic yet darkly comic paranoia about the hallowed institution of childbirth touched a nerve with late-60s audiences feeling uneasy about traditional norms. Produced by B-horror maestro William Castle, Rosemarys Baby became a critically praised hit, winning Gordon an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

Now Hercules has the remarkable strength of a god, but is trapped in the body of a human, and before he learns how to use his power properly he goes through a typically adolescent awkward period. In order to become a god and return to his home on Mount Olympus, Hercules must prove himself a true hero on Earth. With the assistance of Philotes (voice of Danny De Vito), a plucky satyr known as ""Phil,"" the grown-up Hercules (voice of Tate Donovan) learns to use his strength to his advantage and becomes a famous and benevolent protector of those around him, successfully battling a variety of gods and monsters. However, Hades, wanting to cut Hercules down to size, sends his secret weapon after him -- Megara (voice of Susan Egan), a seductively beautiful woman under Hades control, who is to win Hercules heart and render him helpless against the forces of the underworld.

Working within a special production unit at RKO Pictures, Lewtons films were mood pieces that created an atmosphere of anxiety rather than aiming for blunt shocks, and used shadowy camerawork and careful pacing to infer more than the audience actually saw. Several of Lewtons productions became minor hits, most notably Cat People, and a number of others (including Isle Of The Dead, I Walked With A Zombie, Curse Of The Cat People, The Seventh Victim and The Body Snatchers) are cult favorites to this day. Lewton also discovered a number of directors who would become major players later on, including Robert Wise, Mark Robson and Jacques Tourneur, but Lewtons efforts to move on to bigger budget projects fared poorly, and poor health claimed his life in 1951, six years after his last picture for RKO.

Stephen Heywood was 29 years old and had a solid job building houses, as well as a steady girlfriend, when he received word from his doctor that hed been diagnosed with Amyotropic Lateral Sclerosis, a fast-spreading motor neuron condition also known as ""Lou Gehrigs Disease."" ALS robs its victims of the ability to control their muscles, and no cure has been discovered at this time. Stephens brother Jamie responded to this news by quitting his job and starting a scientific research team to ferret out new treatments for the disease (given the small number of people who deal with ALS, few drug companies have stepped forward with medicines to ease its symptoms, believing that they could not turn a profit on the drugs). As Jamie wages a personal war against the medical establishment knowing his brother is getting worse every day, Stephen asks his girlfriend to marry him and they decide to have a baby, determined to squeeze a lifetime into the few years he has left with the unflagging support of his friends and family.
