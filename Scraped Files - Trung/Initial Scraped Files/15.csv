By the time Cagney learned that Fox had no intention of adding songs and dances to the venerable Maxwell Anderson/Laurence Stallings stage piece, it was too late to pull out, so he decided to grin (sometimes) and bear it. Under the direction of John Ford, the potent anti-war message of the original play is blunted, while the drunken rowdiness of Capt. Flagg and his friendly enemy Sergeant Quirt (Dan Dailey) was played for all it was worth and then some. Much of the brawling is over the affections of vivacious barmaid Charmaine, played by Corinne Calvet. Contrasting the rough-hewn hijinks of Flagg, Quirt and their fellow Marines on the fields and in the villages of World War I-era France is the doomed romance between private Robert Wagner and French lass Marisa Pavan. (Why does Wagner get to sing, while Cagney and Dailey do not?) Barry Norton, who played Wagners role in the original What Price Glory? appears in the remake as a priest. Norton is unbilled, as are such familiar faces as Harry Morgan, Paul Fix, Henry Kulky, and John Ford ""regulars"" Dan Borzage and Bill Henry.

Back in the 1960s, Cornell University nutritional scientist Dr. T. Colin Campbell was working to find a way to feed the citizens of impoverished Third World nations when a trip to the Philippines forever changed the way he thought about food consumption. There, he discovered that the rates of liver cancer among affluent children who subsisted on diets rich in animal-based foods were notably higher than in children consuming plant-based diets. Meanwhile, surgeon Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, head of the Breast Cancer Task Force at Cleveland Clinic, was also discovering that many of the diseases he was seeing in patients were practically nonexistent in areas of the world where people were primarily consuming plant foods. Several subsequent investigations by the researchers (who would not meet each other until the 1980s), including a groundbreaking study in China by Dr. Campbell, led them to the revelation that a whole-food, plant-based diet could prevent, and even reverse, such degenerative conditions as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. In this film, Fulkerson examines Dr. Campbells and Dr. Esselstyns theories by following the two doctors individual, yet very similar, story arcs, from their farm-based upbringings to their astounding discoveries. The film also records the experiences of a group of patients suffering from chronic maladies as they participate in an experiment in which their diets are substantially altered and wholesome, plant-based food is, essentially, used as medicine. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi",PG (for some thematic elements and incidental smoking),"Documentary, Special Interest, Sports & Fitness",Lee Fulkerson,Monica Beach Enterprises,94 minutes,"Joey Aucoin, Neal Barnard, Gene Baur"

398,19466,Behind The Burly Q,N/A,78%,27,64%,147,"Although its origins derive from France, Great Britain and Greece, burlesque became a wildly popularAmerican form of art that thrived in the early to mid part of the 20th century. Because of the sexualinnuendo and the barely-there costumes it has largely been left out of the history books.In the 1840s burlesque was applied to a wide range of comedic plays that entertained the lower and middleclasses in Great Britain. Coming to America, burlesque evolved into shows performed by scantily-cladbeauties. It thrived, appealing to the masses of working class people who weekly stormed the theatres tosee troupes like ""The British Blondes"", a bevy of beauties dressed in tights. Burlesque poked fun at theupper classes, at sex, and at what people were willing to do in the pursuit of obtaining sex. By the 1920sthe old burlesque circuits closed and strip tease was introduced to offer something vaudeville and film didnot.During the Great Depression, for a dime a man could fall into a big gaudy burlesque show and forget histroubles. From theatres to nightclubs, burlesque was a raucous sexy show filled with gorgeous women,strippers, comedians, acrobats and singers. The tame by todays standards, the shows were consideredrisqué, and most performers were looked down on as second rate.Backed by public outrage, in 1937 New York Mayor Fiorello La Guardia closed the burlesque houses in hisstate. The use of the word ""burlesque"" was outlawed in advertising. The Minsky brothers, who some sayintroduced nudity to the burly audiences, were so closely associated with burlesque that La Guardia bannedthe use of the name Minsky. Once again, burlesque changed, moving across the river to New Jersey toescape censure. Eventually comedians and musicians parts were reduced in the shows and more stripperswere brought on. By the 1960s hard-core porn was available and burlesque had died. But what happened tothe thousands of performers? Where did they go?""Behind the Burly Q"" is the behind-the-scenes stories of these men and women as told by the performersthemselves. For the first time ever, the performers from the golden age of burlesque relate theirheartbreaking, triumphant stories of life on the road performing in the burly circuit. Many were ashamed oftheir past and had never talked about their experiences. Just as many had never been asked.Director Leslie Zemeckis and producer Sheri Hellard traveled extensively across the country from theBayous of post-Katrina Mississippi, to New Jersey, Florida and all points between. The duo tracked downand recorded dozens of interviews with little-known performers to the last of the living legends ofburlesque. They spoke with relatives of many deceased stars. The men and women in this documentaryopened their scrapbooks as well as their hearts, relating memories they had all but forgotten.Amongst those interviewed were former musicians, strippers, novelty acts, club owners, funny men andwomen, authors and historians assembled together for the first time ever to tell you just what reallyhappened in a burlesque show. Sadly, many of the performers have since passed away, making this theirlast, and often times only interview. We dedicate this film to their memory.""Behind the Burly Q"" is the definitive history of burlesque during its heyday. Funny, shocking,unbelievable and heartbreaking, their stories will touch your hearts. Hear the performers in their ownwords. See the performers in action.

Although Chapman selfishly dropped dead in 1989, he had taken the trouble to record himself reading his book, A Liars Autobiography - and those recordings have now ingeniously been used to provide Chapmans voice for the 3D animated feature of the same name. Fellow Pythons John Cleese, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam also turn up, playing themselves and other characters, along with a few surprise guests. Not a documentary, not a Monty Python film, A Liars Autobiography is Chapmans own take on his bizarre life and his search for self-knowledge. Incredible, yes. Surreal, certainly.
