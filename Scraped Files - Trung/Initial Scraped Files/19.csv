That would not necessarily be a detriment to a film ostensibly warning about the dangers of untreated insanity, but Maniac is so badly handled in an obvious attempt to both horrify and titillate that it defies description. Vaguely based on Poes The Black Cat and referring in several scenes to the same authors Murders in the Rue Morgue, Maniac told a rambling, sometimes incoherent story of a vaudeville impersonator turned lab assistant to an insane scientist. Like most Mad Medicos, Dr. Meirschultz (Horace B. Carpenter) is attempting to bring dead tissue to life but this particular scientist is accidentally killed in the process. His assistant (Bill Woods) takes over his persona, walling up the dead doc in the process. The protagonists increasing dementia -- which threatens to engulf the viewing audience as well -- is depicted via inserts from silent films such as Benjamin Christensens classic Witchcraft Through the Ages and Fritz Langs Siegfried. There is plenty of gratuitous feline footage and at one point the fake Dr. Meirschultz actually devours a cats eye! (""Why,"" he exclaims, ""Its not unlike a grape or an oyster!"") For unexplained reasons, the faux doctor examines a couple of women in various stages of undress. The presence of these women remains vague and they never appear again. There is also a deranged person (Ted Edwards) who believes he is the re-incarnation of the orangutan killer in ""Rue Morgue""; a couple of women fighting with syringes; and various shots of girls lounging about in their underwear for no apparent reason other than audience titillation. Like most exploitation melodramas, Maniac is cast with a mix of has-beens and unknown beginners who remained unknown. Poor Horace B. Carpenter, a silent era producer/director/actor who played whitehaired Western characters in sound films, was made a complete fool in a role perhaps written for the too-expensive Bela Lugosi. Bill Woods and Ted Edwards, as the vaudeville performer and the orangutan wannabe respectively, saw their careers go nowhere but down after Maniac.The Latters wife, incidentally, was played by one Phyllis Diller, a starlet who had absolutely no connection to the later comedienne of the same name; and Marian Blackton, the sister of the films assistant director and daughter of screen pioneer J. Stuart Blackton, appears in male drag as a cat-catching neighbor.

Just before he strides through the banks sliding glass doors, however, he realizes that he forgot one crucial thing -- a gauze face mask (often worn when one has a cold in Japan). He hurries to a nearby convenience store, only to find that it only stocks one in a childs size. Realizing that he also forgot his wallet, the increasingly panicky Yasuda pockets the mask, only to get caught in the act by a store clerk named Aikawa (Diamond Yukai) -- a crank-addicted rock singer whose career is rapidly going south. A tussle ensues, resulting in Yasuda winging the clerk in the arm. Completely terrified, the would-be bank robber drops his gun and flees the store, with Aikawa chasing after him looking for blood. Just as he is about to squeeze off a round at Yasudas head, the clerk runs smack into Takeda (Shinichi Tsutsumi), a third-rate yazuka to whom Aikawa owes a stack of money and who inadvertently started a gang war through his own cowardice. Soon it becomes a three-man race through the streets of Tokyo, with the trios collective sanity slowly starting to erode. Meanwhile, the dark clouds of gangland violence build around them until the films dénouement.

To inject a bit of much-needed humor in the proceedings, director Fritz Lang inserted a scene wherein Ida Lupino puts the make on Dana Andrews by tantalizing him with a nude photograph -- which turns out not to be of Ida but of a baby on a bear rug. Producer Bert Friedlob hated the scene, and insisted upon cutting it out. Lang offered a compromise: if the preview audience laughed, the scene stayed.

This was the treatment afforded the Rudolf Friml-Herbert Stothart-Oscar Hammerstein-Otto Harbach musical Rose Marie--and thank heaven that MGM decided to jettison the originals creaky libretto about a woman who offers her body to the villain to save the hero from a trumped-up murder charge (this chestnut seemed old-fashioned even in 1928, when Joan Crawford starred in the silent version). In lieu of this wearisome storyline, the Eddy-MacDonald version casts MacDonald as a spoiled, temperamental Canadian opera star who learns that her uncontrollable brother (James Stewart), serving a prison sentence, has escaped to a cabin in the North Woods and needs someone to tend his wounds. MacDonald travels to northern Canada incognito, where in a hilarious sequence she tries and fails to pass muster as a dance-hall girl. Upon meeting likeable mountie Nelson Eddy, who unbeknownst to her has been assigned to locate her brother, MacDonald fabricates a story about needing an escort for a rendezvous with her lover.

Despite this rift, a happy--and logical--ending is not long in coming. It might be hard to watch such Eddy-MacDonald duets as ""Rose Marie"" and ""Indian Love Call"" with a completely straight face; it is reassuring, however, to find out that the filmmakers knew that ""Rose Marie"" was ripe for ridicule, and decided to laugh at themselves first in order to disarm the audience.

As Laurence (Joseph Fiennes, brother of Ralph Fiennes) narrates the tale to his neighbor, Dr. Pedersen (Ray Winstone), the scene flashes back to three days earlier: Laurences friend Daniel (Tom Hollander) is in the Minneapolis airport on a business trip when he spots blonde Martha (Monica Potter of Con Air) buying a ""first flight to anywhere."" Daniel sits next to her on the plane and makes a London lunch date with her for the following day, but shes a no-show. He expresses his disappointment to Laurence and unemployed actor Frank (Rufus Sewell of Cold Comfort Farm). Frank meets Martha accidentally in a park, realizes who she is, learns shes in love and she intends to fly back to the U.S., and then makes a move on her (without telling her he knows Daniel). He loses track of her at an art gallery. Later, Laurence reveals that when he missed meeting Daniel at the airport, he wound up meeting Martha instead -- a moment of mutual love. At this point, much like the structure of Stanley Kubricks The Killing (1956), the time is reset and previous events are repeated -- from the POV of another character. The movie is only two-thirds complete when Laurence finishes his recap of the previous three days -- so the story continues from that point.

The picture proved to be a significant success in an otherwise disappointing year for 20th Century Fox. James Mason stars as amusingly absent-minded professor Oliver Lindenbrook, whose first step on a fabulous journey is prompted by a lump of lava brought to him by his student Alec McEwen (Pat Boone -- and, yes, he gets to sing). Melting down the curiously composed lump, Lindenbrook discovers a hastily scrawled message from long-lost explorer Arne Saknussem, with directions for reaching the earths core. Accompanied by Carla (Arlene Dahl), widow of a famed geologist, and Icelandic guide Hans (Peter Ronson), Lindenbrook and Alec head down, down below. They are closely followed by the villainous Count Saknussem (Thayer David), descendant of the lost explorer who wrote the directions; the count hopes to use Lindenbrooks discoveries for his own personal and political gain (we know hes really bad when he eats Hans lovable pet goose). What follows is a festival of superb special effects, fabulous subterranean sets, and gigantized reptiles posing as dinosaurs, all brilliantly accompanied by Bernard Herrmanns ominous musical score.
