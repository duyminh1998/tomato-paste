Dying, the pregnant woman inside orders her grieving husband Frederick (Sam Neill) to cut the baby from her womb, so that at least it might live. Years later, the infant is now headstrong young Lilli (Taryn Davis), who is resentful of her fathers upcoming marriage to Claudia (Sigourney Weaver). Claudia is devoted to the memory of her own mother and installs a magic mirror that belonged to her in a wardrobe in her private room. More time passes; Lilli is now an adult, but her relationship with the now-pregnant Claudia has never improved, though Claudia has never done her any ill. Claudia loses her baby, and on the same night, gazes into her mothers mirror, which shows her an image of herself young and beautiful. She determines to rid herself of Lilli. Lilli is walking near the forest when Claudias mute brother Gustav (Miroslav Taborski) draws a knife and chases the frightened young woman into the forest. She evades him, so he kills a pig and takes the heart to a delighted Claudia, who believes it to be Lillis heart. She has Gustav put the heart in a stew cooking in the kitchen, and that night as she dines with Frederick, Lilli eats the stew with great pleasure. Later, Frederick and some men search for Lilli in the rainy forest. Lilli takes refuge from wolves in a ruined castle, where shes confronted by seven vagabonds whove banned together to seek a lost gold mind. Will (Gil Bellows), scarred during the Crusades, is around Lillis own age and resents her presence, but the older Lars (Brian Glover) is friendlier to her. The mirror tells Claudia that Lilli is still alive, so in the forest where Claudia keeps a shrine to her dead baby, she casts a spell designed to kill her stepdaughter. Lilli, helping the men in their mine, is almost smothered in a cave-in; shes rescued, but one of the men dies. The mirror again tells Claudia that Lilli still lives. Whirling in a black gown, Claudia conjures a wind that strikes the forest; giant trees topple all around Lilli and the men, killing Lars, but Lilli still lives. So the mirror now transforms Claudia into a bald old hag, and she goes into the forest herself. She offers an apple to Lilli, who takes one bite and falls into a trance that no one can tell from death. Shes placed in a stained-glass coffin and lowered into the ground, but the agonized Will, whos fallen in love with her, lifts her from the coffin and a piece of apple falls from her mouth. She returns to life, and they all head for the castle. She arrives in time to interrupt Claudia in the act of slashing Fredericks throat, then confronts Lilli in a room full of mirrors. (Theres a hint that Claudia had a part in the death of Lillis mother.) Lilli stabs not Claudia but her mirror image. It bursts apart, shredding and burning Claudia to death. This bold movie out-grims the Brothers Grimm, telling their oft-told tale as a horror movie/adventure -- and it works. In fact, the weakness of the movie is precisely that the story is so familiar, but the changes wrought by the writers and director keep it fresh for most of its length. Its handsomely designed, using real locations and costumes that are never too grand for the setting. Weaver is clearly having a great time as the not-so-wicked stepmother who eventually becomes a vengeful witch. Especially for a fairy tale, the characters are complex and not necessarily always likable; even Lilli (who is never called ""Snow White"") has a hard edge, and her ""Prince Charming"" is a bitter, scarred commoner. Its a shame this attractive, imaginative film didnt have any theatrical release in the United States; originality, especially in a field as well-ploughed as fairy tales, should be encouraged. ~ Bill Warren, Rovi","R (adult situations/language, violence)","Horror, Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Michael Cohn,Universal Pictures,101 minutes,"Sigourney Weaver, Sam Neill, Gil Bellows"

The story the girls told captured the war-weary imagination of Britishers everywhere. That the girls later admitted it was all a hoax, didnt matter much to ""true believers"" of fairy and magic books. This tale, like the original story, is set in the British countryside but centers on a jaded WW I photographer who makes a living in 1918 London debunking phony pictures of ghosts and other supernatural phenomenon -- that is until one day a woman brings him a picture of a fairy that defies explanation. Charles Castle didnt set out to be a hard case towards humanity, It just happened. Shortly after his wedding day, his new bride Anne-Marie died after falling down a suddenly appearing ice fissure on a Swiss Alp. He has never gotten over his grief and desperately wants to see and speak to her again. Charles spends the war on battlefields photographing the dead. The photo that changes his life is given to him by the enigmatic Bea Templeton who claims that her daughters took the picture outside their country home. Unable to restrain his curiosity, Charles visits the area. Soon after, Bea dies mysteriously, and Charles becomes obsessed with the idea that talking to the fairies will somehow allow him the chance to contact his late wife. A magic white flower provides the key to his happiness and helps lead into the storys beautifully done climax. Parents may want to know that some of the fairies appear in various states of undress. This is one of two 1997 films based on the same true story.

Looking to trade his bottom-of-the-barrel career as a strip-club bouncer for more lucrative and exciting prospects, Jimmy jumps when Pando offers him an entry-level position as a courier. But what seems to be the simplest of jobs turns perilously awry when Jimmy takes a postheist breather at the beach and allows his overrevved, adolescent libido to bury reason--and ten thousand dollars in cash--in the sand.

However, when Carter learns that a number of his players have let their grade point averages slip below 2.3, as mandated in a contract he entered into with the students, he decides to lock the team out of the gym and send them into study hall until their marks improve. Carters plan quickly becomes a subject of controversy among parents and team boosters, and their objections are soon picked up by the local news media, many of whom are not sympathetic to Carters belief that his players must have goals beyond college ball or the NBA.

We open on the now-famous scenes of a remote, burning desert fort, manned by the dead Foreign Legionnaires, then flash back to the early lives of the Geste brothers. As children, the Gestes swear eternal loyalty to one another and to their family. One of the boys, young Beau (played as a youth by Donald OConnor), witnesses his beloved aunt (Heather Thatcher) apparently stealing a valuable family jewel in order to finance the Geste home; Beau chooses to remain silent rather than disgrace his aunt. Years later, the grown Beau (Gary Cooper) again protects his aunt by confessing to the theft and running off to join the Foreign Legion. He is joined in uniform by faithful brothers John (Ray Milland) and Digby (Robert Preston), who in turn are pursued by a slimy thief (J. Carroll Naish). The crook is in cahoots with sadistic Legion Sgt. Markov (Brian Donlevy, in one of the most hateful portrayals ever captured on celluloid), who is later put in charge of Fort Zinderneuf, where Beau and John are stationed. When the Arabs attack, Markov proves himself a valiant soldier; it is he who hits upon the idea of convincing the Arabs that the fort is still fully manned by propping up the corpses of the casualties at the guard posts. Beau is seriously wounded, and while the greedy Markov searches for the jewel supposedly hidden on Beaus person, he is held at bay by loyal John. The suddenly enervated Beau kills Markov, then dies himself--but not before entrusting two notes to John, one of which requests that John give Beau the ""Viking funeral"" hed always wanted (this is why the fort is in flames at the beginning of the film). After the battle, Digby Geste, a bugler with the relief troops, comes upon Beaus dead body, and appropriates the notes. As it turns out, John Geste is the only one who survives to return to England. He gives his aunt Beaus letter, which explains why Beau had confessed and run off--""a beau geste, indeed"" comments his tearful aunt.

His best friend is Swan Bostrom (Walter Brennan), a big-hearted Swede. The ambitious Barney presents an idea that gets the attention of his boss, even when Barney suggests they become partners. At a boisterous tavern, Barney and Swan meet the cynical, opportunistic Lotta (Frances Farmer), but she and Barney quickly fall in love. However, his boss sends Barney a telegram that makes it clear their partnership depends on Barney marrying the boss unattractive daughter, Emma Louise. Barney decides to take the offer, and leaves it to Swan to break the news to Lotta; shes so unhappy that the kind Swan proposes to her himself. Twenty-five years or so pass; Barney is now the richest man in the state, wealthy from timber and paper mill interests, and living in a fine house far from Iron Ridge. Little love is lost between Barney and his socially-conscious wife (Mary Nash). Hes closer to his son Richard (Joel McCrea), though uninterested in Richards ideas for marketing paper cups, and not entirely happy that his daughter Evvie (Andrea Leeds) is engaged to the scion of a wealthy family -- nor is Evvie herself really happy about this. Things undergo a major change when Barney gets a telegram from Swan, whom he hasnt seen in 20 years. Lotta died some time ago, and Swan is lonely for his old friend. Barney impulsively returns to Iron Ridge, where hes warmly greeted by Swan -- and astonished to learn that Swans daughter, also called Lotta (also Farmer), is almost the double of her mother, though her temperament is very different. Barney is almost immediately smitten by the young Lotta, who is eager to get out of Iron Ridge and see more of the world. He takes her and some friends to Chicago, where he imagines that she is falling in love with him, too. However, when she meets Richard, Lotta is instead attracted to him, considering Barney just a nice -- and very generous -- man of her fathers generation. Meanwhile, Evvie has become attracted to a ""bohunk,"" Tony Schwerke (Frank Shields), who works in one of her fathers factory. When Barney confronts the young man, hes impressed by his nerve and intelligence, and begins to think he might not make such a bad husband for his daughter. Things come to a head at the annual Employee Banquet, held as always on the Glasgow estate. Barney finds Lotta kissing Richard, and slaps his son -- who knocks his father to the floor. Now realizing what a fool hes made of himself, Barney is comforted by the understanding Swan. Barney gathers some of his old strength to ring the big triangle on the porch and announces the banquet has begun: ""Come and get it!"" Never as good as it keeps promising to be, ""Come and Get It"" was a troubled production from the beginning. Director Howard Hawks liked the first part of the story, as can be seen in his exuberant filming of an elaborate saloon brawl involving a lot of big metal trays flung around the room by Arnold, Farmer and Brennan. But he never warmed up to the more melodramatic second half of the film, and kept encountering interference from the very hands-on producer Samuel Goldwyn. Finally, after 40+ days of shooting, Hawks left the film; stories differ as to whether he quit or was fired, but he was replaced by a disgruntled William Wyler for the last 28 days of shooting. Neither director was satisfied with the result, and the movie was a box-office disappointment. Arnold is not well-cast in a role that called for a younger, more outdoorsy man, but his expansive personality does fit the older Barney reasonably well. Frances Farmer, in her first major film, is outstanding as both Lottas, especially the mother. And Brennan, often in Hawks movies, won the Supporting Actor Oscar for his role as the good-hearted Swede. Viewers today are actually more likely to enjoy the film than the original audiences; this kind of big-scale melodrama is rarely attempted today, and the aroma of failure has long since evaporated.

During one of the Earls nocturnal forays, nouveau riche American cattle baron Egbert Floud (Charles Ruggles) wins Ruggles in a poker game. Terrified at the prospect of being bundled off to the Wild West, Ruggles resolve is weakened somewhat when he and the raucous but ingratiating Egbert spend a wild night on the town. (The besotted butlers periodic exclamations of ""Whoopee!"" are priceless.) Back in the frontier ""boom town"" of Red Gap, a misunderstanding obliges Egberts social-climbing wife Effie (Mary Boland) to pass off Ruggles as an aristocratic British army officer, immediately arousing the suspicions of priggish social arbiter Charles Belknap-Jackson (Lucien Littlefield). The longer he spends in America, the more Ruggles grows to like the concept of democracy and self-determination. Of the films many highlights, two are standouts: the scene in which Ruggles silences a rowdy saloon crowd with his recitation of Lincolns Gettysburg Address, and the droll, semi-improvised vignette in which dancehall girl Nell Kenner (Leila Hyams) teaches the Earl of Burnstead how to play the drums.

Anns grandfather, Pop Dillon (Bert Woodruff), meanwhile, has a dilemma -- he runs the last horse-drawn trolley in New York City, and the railway magnates desperately want his route. Since Pop wont sell it to them, they plan to get it by underhanded means. Pop must make his rounds at least once every 24 hours, so the magnates hire thugs to stop him. Speedy hears about this plan and, being gainfully unemployed, takes over the route to protect the old man. But the magnates then steal the trolley, and the climax of the film involves Speedys dash to find the trolley and get it back to its route before the 24 hours are up. He makes it just in time and then forces the magnates to buy the route for a cool 100,000 dollars.

Shes well dressed, with a very ornate hat topping off her ensemble, and also seems even sadder and more lost than he is. Henderson persuades her to join him in taking advantage of the two theater tickets he has. They attend the show -- a song-and-dance showcase by a Brazilian artist (Aurora) -- and then part company without ever exchanging names. He returns home to find three detectives in his apartment and his wife strangled. Inspector Burgess (Thomas Gomez) questions Henderson and tries to verify his alibi, but no one -- not the bartender, the cabbie who hauled them to the theater, or the drummer in the band who was watching her -- admits to remembering the woman. Henderson cant prove that he was elsewhere when his wife was strangled and is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. His assistant, Carol Richman (Ella Raines), who has watched all of this happen, cant sit by while Scott is destroyed, and decides to get at the truth, joined by Inspector Burgess, who now believes Henderson to be innocent. Carol hounds the bartender (Andrew Tombes) until he seems ready to crack, but before he talks, he tries to get away from her and dies in an accident. The drummer, Cliff Milburn (Elisha Cook Jr.), proves more talkative and reveals that someone paid him 500 dollars to forget about the woman, but before Burgess can question him, hes strangled. It seems as though theres no hope left, even with the added help of Jack Marlow (Franchot Tone), Scotts best friend, newly returned from Brazil, when Carol gets a line on the unusual hat the woman was wearing. She traces the hat to its owner in a mansion on Long Island, where she is recovering from a breakdown over the death of her fiancé -- that was her trouble on the night she crossed paths with Scott Henderson. It is only on returning to New York, while awaiting Burgess arrival, that she realizes that Jack Marlow is the murderer -- that he returned after having dinner with them, following their fight, and strangled Hendersons wife; paid off the bartender, the cab driver, and Cliff Milburn to keep them from revealing the existence of the woman that Scott was with; and killed Milburn to prevent him from talking; and he plans to kill Carol before she can talk to Burgess. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi",NR,"Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Robert Siodmak,UN,87 minutes,"Ella Raines, Alan Curtis, Franchot Tone"
