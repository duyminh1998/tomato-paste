A stocky, goofy comic who often turned up in big screen farces such as LAile Ou la Cuisse (1976) and Inspecteur la Bavure (1980) , Colucci gained notoriety for his emotionally rocky and stormy personal life that witnessed him battling alcoholism and extreme drug addiction - making him something of a French equivalent to John Belushi or Chris Farley. Unlike Belushi or Farley, however, Coluche made the unusual decision (for one of his background) to briefly enter mainstream politics. In a bid for the French presidential nomination in 1981, he delighted many and shocked others by reeling in an impressive 15% of the French popular vote - reason enough to believe that this actor, with solid humanitarian values and a commitment to civil rights, might have actually stood a solid chance had he campaigned more aggressively and remained in the running for a longer period. Antoine de Cauness biopic Coluche, lHistoire dun mec hones in exclusively on this intriguing period of the comics life and career, with François-Xavier Demaison playing the famous actor. The tale begins with his impulsive and drug-fueled decision to run on the ticket, coaxing bums, drunks and social outcasts to band together and lay waste to mainstream politicians. When Coluche pulls in around 10% of the vote, he draws the ire of politicos François Mitterand and Valerie Giscard dEstaing, who promptly send out an advisor to dissuade the funnyman from running. Director de Caunes spends the majority of the film cross-cutting between recreations of Coluches popular stage acts, and a not uncritical look at the stars attempts to push himself to his very limits and beyond -- with a mainstream political run that began as a joke but quickly took on very real and frightening proportions.",NR,"Art House & International, Drama",Antoine de Caunes,N/A,N/A,"François-Xavier Demaison, Léa Drucker, Olivier Gourmet"

Once again, the exotic city of Istanbul is the place of intrigue. But, unlike Hamam, which was a contemporary story, Harem Suare takes place at the turn of the century in the last days of the Ottoman Empire. The locale of this ornate story of love, power, and fear is the magnificent Yildiz Palace, where Sultan Abdulhamit whiles away the time listening to the finale of La Traviata as rebellions rage all over the country. The Sultan cannot stand unhappy endings, so he has asked Safiye, his favorite concubine, who is Italian, to rewrite the libretto so that Violetta does not die. Nadir, one of the black eunuchs, has plans for Safiye, whom he thinks should become the official wife. Nadirs plans take a different turn when he and Safiye fall in love. In the harem, which is isolated from the rest of the world, life goes on with its plots and subplots, loyalties and betrayals, happiness and tragedies as if time did not exist. The story is told from the point of view of Safiye, concentrating more on human relations than on palace politics. The director plays with mirror images to reflect the two faces of personalities and the complexities of intercultural relations. Mythology is blended with sexuality, emphasizing the delicate nuances of language. The exotic element is not abused and historical details are used sparingly and only when necessary. Acting by young French actress Marie Gillain, who plays Safiye, and Lucia Bose, who plays her in old age, as well as Alex Descas as the eunuch Nadir and famous Turkish actor Haluk Bilginer as Sultan Abdulhamid are all commendable. 52nd Cannes Film Festival, 1999. ~ Gönül Dönmez-Colin, Rovi",R,"Art House & International, Drama",Ferzan Ozpetek,N/A,110 minutes,"Marie Gillain, Alex Descas, Lucia Bosé"

It seems that the companys models, whove always been willing to ""date"" the visiting buyers looking for a night out, are too hard-boiled and mercenary for the taste of most of these men, and hes losing business -- and maybe his whole business -- because of it. Then his ace salesman, Tommy Nelson (Regis Toomey), has a brainstorm -- let them take out the girls in the companys stenographic pool; after all, as he reasons it out, theyre nice girls and it will do them good to get out to a show and a good restaurant once in a while, and the buyers wont be hit up for cash or encouraged to give them expensive gifts. It will all be nice and innocent, or so he thinks, and the girls will get a bonus for their after-hours work -- although as one of the stenographers remarks, cautioning the others, ""You may get a lot more than a bonus from a buyer."" And that all works out until Tommys own secretary/fiancee, Florence Denny (Loretta Young), becomes the object of interest for rakish businessman Danny Drew (Lyle Talbot). Tommys jealousy kicks in and Flo is unfairly accused of being unfaithful. But her much more knowing, cynical friend Maizie (Winnie Lightner), whos been around the block a few times, shows her the truth -- that Tommy is no better or more faithful than the worst of the men who come into the office, and should be the last one to be making accusations. Now its Flos turn to be outraged, especially as he wont admit what he actually was doing. Soon their engagement is over and Flo is out of a job. Danny, trying to be a nice guy but clueless about what Flo is about, comes along with an offer that may get her lots of money but also wreck her reputation, and says something so awful about what he thinks she is, that she almost shocks the audience by agreeing to it. But she acquits herself in a way that is honorable and gets Danny what he wants in business -- a fact that has him thinking even less of her than he did before. For a time Flo is caught between Tommy and Danny, neither of whom thinks as highly of her as she deserves -- and she gets to Danny precisely how unfair he and almost every other man is to the women around them. The film ends in what is basically a race to see which of these two men wises up to how nice a girl she really is, and if they can wise up in time.

But as Brights star rises, his worst qualities come to the surface; he becomes an arrogant alcoholic who cant stay faithful to his wife, and while his first feature film, Forget Me Not, is a major success, his career quickly goes into a tailspin, and with the arrival of the talkies Bright is a has-been. In the 1960s, with a revival of interest in silent films, Bright is able to make a few bucks appearing in television commercials, but it doesnt take much success for his bad habits to take hold again.

Performance artist Qi Leis obsession with death, coupled with his frustration over a materialistic modern Chinese society and a government that stifles independent artistic expression, leads him to devise his latest cycle of pieces. The first two show him ""dying"" by drowning and by immolation. His third and final performance will have him slowly freezing himself to death. His lover Shao Yun and his family try to stop him, but the determined Qi will not give up his plans. With the help of a few art students, he performs the first two pieces. Officially considered dead, Qi hides out and begins observing life in the world without him. Nothing he sees inspires hope.

After a couple of comic misunderstandings, Nisha takes an interest in Rohit. Rohit asks Nisha to teach him computers, and they dig up his fathers old device, inadvertently sending another message into space.

The nominal plot involves five vacationing college kids -- Ash (Bruce Campbell), his girlfriend Linda (Betsy Baker), and their classmates Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss), Scott (Hal Delrich) and Shelly (Sarah York) -- making an unplanned stopover in an abandoned mountain cabin surrounded by impenetrable woods. Before settling in for the night, they come across an ancient-looking occult tome filled with dense hieroglyphics and macabre illustrations, a dagger fashioned from human bones, and a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The taped message, dictated by a professor of archaeology, describes the contents of the Sumerian ""Book of the Dead,"" filled with incantations used to bring otherworldly demons to life, giving them license to possess the living. The message goes on to explain that those possessed by these demons can only be stopped by total bodily dismemberment. When played among the group later that evening, the professors recorded translations of the ritual chants traumatize the strangely prescient Shelly ... and simultaneously release an ominous presence from the depths of the forest. The evil spirits take to their dirty work with gusto, first assuming control of Shelly and transforming her into a cackling, murderous hag with superhuman strength; the others imprison her in the fruit cellar and chain the trapdoor shut. The spirits then begin to possess the other women, including Linda -- who immediately turns on Ash with a barrage of punches and sadistic taunts. Unable to bring himself to chop up his lovers corpse, Ash gives her a more customary burial in the woods -- which proves to be a big mistake. As the others succumb to demonic influence, Ashs horrific predicament becomes increasingly grim until, when all hope seems lost, he stumbles upon a final, desperate solution to the ghoulish onslaught ... well, maybe not. Despite the shoestring production values, Raimi has fashioned a tight, lightning-paced fever dream of a movie, filled with operatic overacting and outrageously gory effects that give the project a comic-book feel. Based on an earlier 8mm short titled Within the Woods, this feature version was fraught with distribution difficulties before finding its first audience overseas. After considerable word of mouth (and a glowing endorsement from horror author Stephen King), the film became a hit on home video, where it achieved further notoriety thanks to its highly-publicized banning in Britain amid the notorious ""Video Nasties"" censorship campaign. Raimi, along with producer Robert Tapert, writer Scott Spiegel and much of the same crew, cranked up the storys comic aspects several dozen notches for the rollicking semi-remake, Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn. ~ Cavett Binion, Rovi",R (for substantial graphic horror violence and gore),"Horror, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Sam Raimi,New Line Cinema,85 minutes,"Bruce Campbell, Ellen Sandweiss, Betsy Baker"

Instead, Number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.

During the Fifties and Sixties, Castle was one of Hollywoods greatest and most shameless showmen, and he achieved some of his greatest box office successes with movies promoted with outlandish gimmicks. Castles reign as the King of Gimmicks began with 1958s Macabre, in which he gave each member of the audience a $1,000 insurance policy against being scared to death by the film. With his next release, 1959s House on Haunted Hill, theaters were equipped with ""Emergo,"" in which a plastic skeleton would fly through the theater on wires at certain moments in the action, and for The Tingler, released later the same year, seats were wired with electrical buzzers to give patrons a shock as ""materialized fear"" stalked the screening room. While Castle later took up more respectable projects -- most notably producing Roman Polanskis film Rosemarys Baby and collaborating with famous mime Marcel Marceau on the bizarre fantasy Shanks -- his playful, gimmicky horror films are still remembered by film fans today, and Jeffrey Schwartz pays homage to his life and career in the documentary Spine Tingler!: The William Castle Story. In addition to clips from many of Castles movies (as well as their trailers, many of which featured the director explaining his latest gimmick to prospective patrons), Spine Tingler! includes interviews with a number of fans and fellow filmmakers, including John Waters, Joe Dante, Leonard Maltin, Roger Corman and John Landis; the film received the audience award at the 2007 American Film Institute Film Festival.",NR,"Documentary, Television",Jeffrey Schwarz,Automat Pictures,82 minutes,"Forrest J Ackerman, John Badham, Diane Baker"

Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes) is a young and vital member of the aristocratic classes in 16th century Italy; however, Bassanios impulsive nature and lavish lifestyle have put him deeply in debt, and he will need at least the pretense of a fortune if he is to win the hand of the beautiful Portia (Lynn Collins). Bassanio turns to his close friend Antonio (Jeremy Irons), a successful businessman, for financial help, but with much of his fortune tied up in a sailing expedition, Antonio can do little to help him. To help Bassanio, Antonio turns to Shylock (Al Pacino), a Jewish money lender who lives in Venices Semetic ghetto. Antonio has often expressed his contempt for Shylock, who charges high rates for his loans, and Shylock clearly seems pleased at the ironic prospect of having Antonio as a customer; however, instead of interest, Shylock demands an unusual security on his loan -- though Shylock demands no interest, if Antonio does not repay the three thousand ducats in three months, Shylock will be entitled to a pound of his flesh. This version of The Merchant of Venice was directed by Michael Radford, best known for the international hit Il Postino, and was shot on locations in Venice and Luxembourg. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",R (for some nudity),"Art House & International, Comedy, Drama, Special Interest",Michael Radford,Sony Pictures Classics,138 minutes,"Al Pacino, Jeremy Irons, Joseph Fiennes"

For years, physicians and drug companies sought a solution; then one arrived in the 1960s. A medication called Factorate seemed to help hemophiliacs immeasurably, and doctors, scientists and drug companies routinely touted it as a ""miracle cure."" Yet a delayed tragedy ensued: in preparing this formula, manufacturers collected plasma from sketchy sources and donors such as prison inmates, failed to do proper blood screenings, and all but ignored the tide of HIV and AIDS sufferers during the early 1980s. As a result, and estimated 10,000 hemophiliacs (including children) were infected with HIV and 15,000 contracted hepatitis. This quickly went down as the single worst medical disaster in U.S. history. Marilyn Nesss documentary Bad Blood relays this tragic story from the perspective of six families whose lives were ruined by the malpractice, as well as the vantage point of the doctors, nurses and scientists responsible. The program then expands from this focus to examine the broader issue of government regulation of the pharmaceutical industry. ~ Nathan Southern, Rovi",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest",Marilyn Ness,Necessary Films,82 minutes,"Anne Carney, Regina Butler, David Castaldi"

By 1914 Weber was a well-known director when she went to work for the Bosworth Company to make Hypocrites. Hypocrites is an amazingly complex film in both narrative and technique, following the parallel stories of an early Christian ascetic and a modern minister, with most actors in dual roles. Gabriel (Courtney Foote) is a medieval monk who devotes himself to completing a statue of ""Truth,"" only to be murdered by a mob when his work turns out to be an image of a naked woman. The contemporary Gabriel is the pastor of a large urban congregation for whom religion is a matter of appearances, not beliefs. The hypocrisy of the congregation is exposed by a series of vignettes in which the Naked Truth, literally portrayed by a nude woman, reveals their appetites for money, sex, and power. Hypocrites was a shocking and controversial film whose release was held up for many months by the difficulty of distributing a film with full nudity. Webers sincerity and reputation allowed her to use something that in the hands of a male director would have been considered scandalous and immoral. Widely admired at the time for extraordinary use of multiple exposures and intricate editing, Hypocrites propelled Weber to the front ranks of silent directors.",NR,Drama,"Lois Weber, George Loane Tucker",N/A,N/A,"Courtney Foote, Courtenay Foote, Elisabeth Risdon"

Yet, in our contemporary lore this mighty black-and-white mammal is like a two-faced Janus-beloved as a majestic, friendly giant yet infamous for its capacity to kill viciously.

Those who refuse are ticketed for sterilization, or worse. One of the holdouts is Bonita Granville, a German girl raised and educated in America whose taste of democracy has made her utterly resistant to Nazism. In the films key scene, the near-naked Bonita is publicly flogged for her defiance, whereupon Bonitas lover, ""good Nazi"" Tim Holt, suddenly has an awakening of conscience and stops the whipping. This act of courage results in the executions of both Holt and Granville, but they willingly go to their deaths rather than accede to Hitlers demands. It is true enough that many people flocked to see Hitlers Children because of the sensational, censor-provoking aspects of the film, but equal numbers of filmgoers and critics also recognized the above-average artistic contributions of director Edward Dmytryk and scriptwriter Emmet Lavery (both of whom received substantial cash bonuses for their work on this film).

Four felons are guaranteed a bundle of money just to baby-sit/guard a high-tech box until delivery the next morning. In this box is something very bizarre. This thing-this ""item"" which resembles a forty-pound worm-looks harmless when harnessed into its container, but it possesses the peculiar power to look into hearts and harvest truth. It exploits its victims every repressed weirdness and lurking subconscious fear to its own advantage. With the clock ticking and tension rising and way-too-many loaded guns in the room, this get-rich-quick scheme turns into an adolescent fantasy of bloody mayhem and murder. Where Hollywood has gone astray spending millions to make a monster look ""real,"" this modestly budgeted film becomes vibrant through its writing and style. The item may be smaller than Godzilla, but it is much more complex and horrifying. Director Dan Clark takes delight in the details, both physical and mental, of this motley group of degenerates. When blood flows, which it does often, it splatters the wall in gallons. Shot in digital beta format, The Item is a striking example of the possibilities of this new medium in the hands of good actors and a creative storyteller.

It examines the idea that horror films reflect the times and places in which they are made -- illustrating how classic monster movies exploited the anxieties of war-time generations, and how more savage modern horror films stem from the psychic fallout of Americas counterculture movement and the subsequent rise of increasingly conservative political forces.At the same time, the documentary explores the timeless, universal appeal of horror movies by examining the pervasive theme of The Outsider. From the silent films of Lon Chaney to the box office reign of Hannibal Lector and his peers, the history of the horror film is a story of the individual at odds with any organization that threatens his life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. In-depth interviews with many of the nations greatest horror filmmakers reveal that the appeal of the genre is rooted not only in timely fears but in the spirit of rebellion -- a spirit that consistently defines American life, as well as many of its best horror filmmakers.Nightmares in Red, White and Blue is narrated by horror icon Lance Henriksen and features exclusive interviews with legendary auteurs like John Carpenter, George A. Romero, Joe Dante, Larry Cohen, and Roger Corman, as well as film historian John Kenneth Muir and Fangoria editor Tony Timpone and others. Their observations are illustrated with clips from more than 150 films -- ranging from the classic Universal monster movies to the psychological horrors of film noir, from groundbreaking films like Night of the Living Dead, Rosemarys Baby, The Exorcist and Jaws to contemporary slasher movies, Torture Porn and beyond.In short, it is the most comprehensive documentary on Americas most durable and prolific film genre. -- (C) Official Site",R,"Documentary, Television",Andrew Monument,Lux Digital Pictures,96 minutes,"Lance Henriksen, Joe Dante, John Carpenter"

(The man dyed his hair and wore makeup in an era when women were looked on with disapproval for such behavior!) Director Jack Gold handles the material with taste, discretion, and a generous supply of humor; it thus might seem bizarre to a contemporary viewer that anyone could be offended by this, but remember that the world was a different place in 1975. More than a few PBS subscribers threatened to yank their support when this British TV film was first offered to American viewers in the spring of that year. Fortunately, many others were willing to see beyond the films controversial subject matter and revel in the excellence of the production and its participants; one of the films biggest and most influential fans was none other than Milton Berle. Carl Davis, best known for his symphonic silent-movie restoration scores, composed the music.

Young Buenos Aires cabdriver Soledad (Vera Fogwill), tired of fending off molesting passengers and dealing with her exploitative boss, keeps driving her cab straight out of the city and into the mountains, arriving at a remote and dusty Patagonian village, Rio Pico. The towns only contact with the outside world is a cinema which shows film reels out of sequence or upside-down -- as referenced in the titles reversal of Gone With the Wind. This has impacted on local inhabitants, causing them to speak in non sequiturs. Soledad checks into an inn run by Doña Maria (Angela Molina), and when locals find out she was a journalism student, they ask her to host their newsreels about life in Rio Pico. Her new job as news anchor leads to a romance with film critic Pedro (Fabian Vena). Doña Marie finds love blossoming when faded French film star Edgar Wexley (Jean Rochefort) arrives in town as a result of massive amounts of fan mail.

They discover that the notion of the ""Allied forces"" is breaking down amid their victory in the war; they neither like nor trust each other, nor each others countries, except where the Germans are concerned, where they share a distrust. And then they cross paths with a German VIP who makes them wonder if theyve got all of the Germans pegged right. A bomb goes off, killing their newfound acquaintance, and the suspicions start anew. The mystery surrounding the victim only deepens when they discover that he wasnt who he claimed to be -- and that the army isnt saying who he was. Ryan, Oberon, et al. soon find themselves up to their necks in unrepentant Nazis and militant German nationalists who have banded together against the occupiers to destroy any chance of success for a peace plan being put forward by a visionary German (Paul Lukas). They find Frankfurt a hotbed of sabotage and armed underground resistance, with the occupying armies seemingly caught flat-footed by the plotting in their midst, which includes murder and blackmail. Berlin Express is a spellbinding mix of action, suspense, and topical political intrigue, laced with idealism and a surprising degree of sophistication, a level a wit almost worthy of Graham Greene, and an eye for suspense worthy of Hitchcock. Indeed, the film could almost be considered director Jacques Tourneurs postwar equivalent to Hitchcocks Foreign Correspondent (1940).

The guest list -- comprised of various dignitaries, officials and symbols of bourgeois respectability -- could easily have strolled in from a Fellini film, complete with a closetful of perverse habits and barely-repressed sexual urges. At the onset of the festivities, it is learned that a young girl has been murdered on the streets that night -- an event somehow linked to Jekylls insistence that his estate be willed to the yet-unseen Mr. Hyde. It comes as no surprise that Jekylls infamous potion transforms him into a crazed sexual predator with desires so aggressive that his victims cannot survive... but the real twist comes when young Fanny joins Jekyll in his bath while he is transforming into Hyde, and the formulas malevolent effects are spread to her as well. Before long, the entire affair devolves into an orgy of sexual sadism and bloody violence as the evil is spread throughout the house. Borowczyk has imbued this quirky exercise with a doomed, nightmarish quality, contrasting the opulence of the festivities with dimly-lit, smoky rooms where the lecherous Hyde stalks his victims.

Donald Sutherland and Donald Pleasence head the cast in this story of the aftermath of a brutal murder. The victim, a 17-year-old girl, was apparently raped before she died, leading Carella (Sutherland) to believe that she was killed by a sex maniac. Pedophile Doniac (Pleasence) tops the suspect list, but dont be too sure. The truth is much ""closer to home"" than anyone realizes at first. Lisa Langlois, who made something of a career of Canadian scare flicks, makes her screen debut in Blood Relatives; also appearing, is Chabrols wife Stephane Audran. Blood Relatives was based on a novel by Ed McBain (aka Evan Hunter), of 87th Precinct fame; the film was released in the US in 1981, three years after its completion. ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",R,"Art House & International, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Romance",Claude Chabrol,N/A,N/A,"Donald Sutherland, Stéphane Audran, Laurent Malet"

When Walt Disneys daughters begged him to make a movie of their favorite book, P.L. Travers ""Mary Poppins,"" he made them a promise-one that he didnt realize would take 20 years to keep. In his quest to obtain the rights, Walt comes up against a curmudgeonly, uncompromising writer who has absolutely no intention of letting her beloved magical nanny get mauled by the Hollywood machine. But, as the books stop selling and money grows short, Travers reluctantly agrees to go to Los Angeles to hear Disneys plans for the adaptation. For those two short weeks in 1961, Walt Disney pulls out all the stops. Armed with imaginative storyboards and chirpy songs from the talented Sherman brothers, Walt launches an all-out onslaught on P.L. Travers, but the prickly author doesnt budge. He soon begins to watch helplessly as Travers becomes increasingly immovable and the rights begin to move further away from his grasp. It is only when he reaches into his own childhood that Walt discovers the truth about the ghosts that haunt her, and together they set Mary Poppins free to ultimately make one of the most endearing films in cinematic history. Inspired by true events, ""Saving Mr. Banks"" is the extraordinary, untold story of how Disneys classic ""Mary Poppins"" made it to the screen-and the testy relationship that the legendary Walt Disney had with author P.L. Travers that almost derailed it.

Ferrante wanted to turn the opus into a two-installment omnibus film, and tapped the right-wing filmmaker Guareschi shoot and edit in a similar format. The producer then stitched the Pasolini and Guareschi episodes together to create one feature length film - thereby pitting extreme rightwing and extreme leftwing sentiments against one another - and infuriating Pasolini. Even so, the picture was released and bombed at the box office, then fell out of distribution for nearly five decades.

Smith publicizes this discovery, leading to a barrage of media attention and an onslaught of get-rich-quick entrepreneurs. Not surprisingly, all of this has an adverse effect on the heretofore ""average"" citizens of Grandview; it also seriously threatens Smiths blossoming romance with local girl Mary Peterman (Jane Wyman), who feels that her friends and neighbors are being used, exploited, and in some cases, corrupted. The satirical thrust of the film bogs down into sentimentality toward the end, but its fun while it lasts. One of the colorful supporting characters is played by screwball-comedy favorite Donald Meek, who died during production, necessitating a number of hasty and not altogether successful rewrites.

Beverly Hills divorce lawyer Stephen Blume (George Segal) becomes his own client when his social worker wife Nina (Susan Anspach) throws him out for sleeping with his secretary. Only then does Blume realize that he cant live without Nina, even though she seems fine without him, and he has a new sex partner in divorcée Arlene (Marsha Mason). So what does he do to win Nina back? Befriend her laid-back musician beau, Elmo (Kris Kristofferson), show up at her house with breakfast bagels, eavesdrop on her therapy sessions, and forcibly impregnate her, of course. Banished to their former honeymoon site in Venice, Italy while Nina thinks things over, Blume reflects on his past and his obsession, as he dreamily hopes for the best. Cutting between Blumes musings on love and loss in Venices Piazza San Marco and the events in L.A. that brought him there, Mazursky humorously yet sharply dissects the complications of marriage in the let-it-all-hang-out Me Decade of the 1970s. Blume and Nina face the same dilemma as the couples in Mazurskys 1969 hit Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice: how to mesh traditional vows with the new freedom and its temptations. In this case, it takes a divorce to convince the solipsistic Blume that the woman he wants most is his own wife.

""In 1993 (Kiefer) left his native Germany and settled in Barjac in France, where he bought a derelict silk factory, transforming it into an extraordinary artistic centre... at once the place where his paintings and sculptures are housed and displayed, and a colossal, evolving architectural artwork in itself. Fiennes begins by roaming through the tunnels and corridors of his studio-network: huge, disorienting shapes and forms loom, composed of earth and mud. There are giant, organic pillars, like stalagmites or termite mounds, a visual or conceptual rhyme to the towers built outside... Fienness emphases are almost abstract: color, light, texture, form - and to these, she adds sound, using the music of Jörg Widmann and György Ligeti. Anselms studio is a place where real, hard work is going on: smelting, sawing and hammering... His artistry looks as if it could be taking place centuries ago, and yet it feels very modern...

Approved by director James Cameron, The Abyss: Special Edition is an extended directors cut of the 1989 underwater science fiction epic, reinstating nearly a half hour of footage removed from the original release under studio pressure. Much of the restored footage places the films events in a grander political context, as the crews mission becomes a factor in the dangerous escalation of nuclear tension between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The largest change involves the films ending, which provides further information on the aliens mission on Earth, bringing the film to closer to Camerons intention: a modern remake of Robert Wises The Day the Earth Stood Still. ~ Judd Blaise, Rovi",PG-13,"Mystery & Suspense, Science Fiction & Fantasy",James Cameron,20th Century Fox Film Corporat,140 minutes,"Ed Harris, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Michael Biehn"

Yasuda (Tomoro Taguchi) lives a life of perpetual humiliation: his meek, bumbling ways have made him the disgrace of the kitchen where he works and a failure in the eyes of his bouncy ex-girlfriend, who dumped him for a yuppie in an expensive suit. In a desperate attempt to retain some self-respect and dignity, the cook plots to rob a bank.

He hurries to a nearby convenience store, only to find that it only stocks one in a childs size. Realizing that he also forgot his wallet, the increasingly panicky Yasuda pockets the mask, only to get caught in the act by a store clerk named Aikawa (Diamond Yukai) -- a crank-addicted rock singer whose career is rapidly going south. A tussle ensues, resulting in Yasuda winging the clerk in the arm. Completely terrified, the would-be bank robber drops his gun and flees the store, with Aikawa chasing after him looking for blood.

Once upon a pre-Facebook time, before creative communities became virtual and viral, cultural movements were firmly grounded in geography. And the undisputed center of American - some would say international - art and film was New York City. In particular, downtown Manhattan in the late 1970s and 80s was the anchor of vanguard filmmaking. BLANK CITY tells the long-overdue tale of the motley crew of renegade filmmakers that emerged from an economically bankrupt and dangerous period of New York History. Its a fascinating look at the way this misfit cinema used the deserted, bombed-out Lower East Side landscapes to craft daring works that would go on to profoundly influence Independent Film today. Unlike the much-celebrated punk music scene, this eras thrilling and confrontational underground film movement has never before been chronicled. Directed by French newcomer Céline Danhier, BLANK CITY captures the idiosyncratic, explosive energy of the ""No Wave Cinema"" and ""Cinema of Transgression"" movements. Stark and provocative, the films drew name and inspiration from the French New Wave; as well as Film Noir, and the works of Andy Warhol and John Waters. Filmmakers such as Jim Jarmusch, Eric Mitchell, Beth B, Charlie Ahear, Lizzie Borden and Amos Poe showcased the citys vibrant grit and bore witness to the rising East Village art and rock scenes and the birth of hip hop.

The product of a fractious Brooklyn childhood, capped by the abrupt desertion of his neer-do-well father, Gleason launches his show business career with the motto ""Never depend on anyone."" Yet because of his multitude of insecurities, he demands total loyalty and 100-percent devotion from everyone around him. Trouble is, he has no loyalty or devotion to give in return: Dedicated to his career, his drinking, and his womanizing (not always in that order), Jackie neglects his wife Gen (Gretchen Egolf) and his children, tyrannizes his associates in general and his faithful agent George ""Bullets"" Durgom (Saul Rubinek) in particular, and shamelessly steals other peoples ideas and comedy material, claiming it exclusively as his own. For all his bluster and bullying, Gleason remains likable and arguably even lovable -- just like his most famous TV character, Brooklyn bus driver Ralph Kramden (indeed, the script suggests that Gleason was Kramden and Kramden was Gleason -- and that Jackie was envious of Ralphs ability to ""make things up"" to his long-suffering wife Alice at the end of each Honeymooners sketch). The film is at its best in its re-creations of Gleasons stage and TV triumphs, though one could nitpick about the hazy and often downright inaccurate chronology of events. As the title character, Brad Garrett offers an uncannily on-target portrayal, despite the fact that the 68"" actor was nearly a foot taller than the real Gleason (this discrepancy was amply compensated for by the clever camera angles of cinematographer Neil Roach, not to mention the elevator shoes worn by practically every other member of the cast). Of the supporting players, Gretchen Egolf and Terry Farrell are superb as Jackies first and second wives respectively, while Michael Chieffos portrayal of Art Carney is eerily perfect.

The subway officials are greatly troubled and so call in topographer Daniel Pratt to help them find it. Unfortunately, the tunnel system is so vast and complex, that Pratt must find his mentor Hugo Mistein for help. Unfortunately, he too has disappeared. Fortunately, he left the system plans behind and as Daniel studies them, he comes to the awful realization that the train, which can be heard but not seen, has somehow become trapped in a fourth dimension. His findings attract the attention of local bureaucrats who are too rigid and pragmatic to accept Pratts outlandish theory.

Close gal pals Lila (Leila Bekhti) and Ely (Nakache) may technically be ""working class,"" but both hail from pleasant and stable families, in the quiet neighborhood of Puteaux, just outside of the City of Lights. The allure of the Paris elite is too strong for the women to resist, however, and they begin to pick up tips and tricks from a womens magazine on how to infiltrate haute society. Each girl carves a unique path for herself: Lila meets wealthy Maxx (Simon Buret) at a bar and attaches herself to him. Ely, on the other hand, takes a job babysitting the son of fashion photographer Agathe (Virginie Ledoyen) and her top model, Joan (Linh-Dan Pham), which means that the young woman gets to spend countless evenings with the child in a gorgeous apartment that boasts a spectacular view of The Eiffel Tower. But the new social circles begin to take their toll, both on a familial level - as when Elys cabbie dad (Daniel Cohen) gets humiliated in front of his daughters new friends - and on a romantic level, as when Lila lies to her Puteaux boyfriend about her real motives.

Waifish Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband, Guy (John Cassavetes), move into the Bramford, an old New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and only elderly residents. Neighbors Roman and Minnie Castevet (Sidney Blackmer and Ruth Gordon) soon come nosing around to welcome the Woodhouses to the building; despite Rosemarys reservations about their eccentricity and the weird noises that she keeps hearing, Guy starts spending time with the Castevets. Shortly after Guy lands a plum Broadway role, Minnie starts showing up with homemade chocolate mousse for Rosemary. When Rosemary becomes pregnant after a mousse-provoked nightmare of being raped by a beast, the Castevets take a special interest in her welfare. As the sickened Rosemary becomes increasingly isolated, she begins to suspect that the Castevets circle is not what it seems. The diabolical truth is revealed only after Rosemary gives birth, and the baby is taken away from her. Polanskis camerawork and Richard Sylberts production design transform the realistic setting (shot on-location in Manhattans Dakota apartment building) into a sinister projection of Rosemarys fears, chillingly locating supernatural horror in the familiar by leaving the most grotesque frights to the viewers imagination.

With earthy, razor sharp wit, Bettie tells her life story -- from humble beginnings as one of six children in an impoverished southern family, to high school salutatorian, to scandalous 50s pin-up model, to shocking retirement in 1957 at the peak of her modeling career. Sharing rare details about her short-lived first marriage and many torrid affairs, this keen insiders glimpse follows Bettie through decades of broken marriages, born-again Christianity, and bouts of mental illness, before her ultimate return to the public eye in the early 90s, unaware of her cult status.

That said, this beautifully animated, tuneful version is still a favorite among Disney fans as it follows the good-hearted Cinderella as she bravely endures the abuse and humiliation of her evil and ugly stepmother and step-sisters.

In true Disney fashion, when all the local mice and birds see the girl who has been so kind to them weeping, they gather together and make her a dress. Unfortunately, the sisters find it and destroy it, leaving the heartbroken maiden alone and saddled with many chores on the night of the grand fete. Fortunately, her sorrow attracts the attention of a beneficent fairy godmother who with a merry ""Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo"" and a wave of her wand, creates for Cinderella a fabulous gown and glorious carriage to take her to the ball.

Working within a special production unit at RKO Pictures, Lewtons films were mood pieces that created an atmosphere of anxiety rather than aiming for blunt shocks, and used shadowy camerawork and careful pacing to infer more than the audience actually saw. Several of Lewtons productions became minor hits, most notably Cat People, and a number of others (including Isle Of The Dead, I Walked With A Zombie, Curse Of The Cat People, The Seventh Victim and The Body Snatchers) are cult favorites to this day. Lewton also discovered a number of directors who would become major players later on, including Robert Wise, Mark Robson and Jacques Tourneur, but Lewtons efforts to move on to bigger budget projects fared poorly, and poor health claimed his life in 1951, six years after his last picture for RKO.

Born in Cleveland, OH, in 1913, Wasserman started out booking music for mob-controlled night clubs, and soon became an agent for Music Corporation of America, which became the most lucrative music agency in America. As Wasserman rose through the ranks at MCA, he established such innovative business practices as ""packaging"" talent (booking hot acts only in tandem with other artists who were a harder sell) and took the company into managing acting talent in Hollywood, where he changed the film business forever by negotiating a ground-breaking deal for James Stewart on the film Winchester 73, which reduced the actors up-front salary in favor of a cut of the movies profits, earning the actor a fortune in the process. Under Wassermans tenure at MCA, the company took over Universal Pictures, established the studios television branch (and made enough powerful friends to make it the most important production outlet in the business), created the wildly successful Universal City studio tours, and expanded MCAs recording branch into one of the biggest record companies in the world. Wasserman was also a man with no small degree of political influence (it didnt hurt that Ronald Reagan was one of his early clients when MCA want Hollywood), and was reputed to have some useful connections to organized crime (his personal lawyer was reputed to be the model for Robert Duvalls character in The Godfather). Wasserman was a secretive man who did not give interviews or commit anything to writing if it could be avoided, but he knew nearly everyone of consequence in show business, and The Last Mogul: The Life and Times of Lew Wasserman is a documentary that through interviews with his friends and business associates paints a detailed portrait of his remarkable career, from his childhood in Ohio to his death in 2002.",PG-13,"Documentary, Television",Barry Avrich,ThinkFilm,103 minutes,"Peter Bart, David Brown, Helen Gurley Brown"

The story is set in motion when the Boston Globe gets wind of a determined effort by lawyer Mitchell Garabedian (Ted Danson) to get belated justice for his client Angelo DeFranco (Daniel Baldwin), who as a youngster was repeatedly abused sexually by Father John Geoghan (Steve Shaw). Several of Angelos contemporaries had previously come forth with stories of Father Geoghans misdeeds, and the similar outrages of other priests, but they had made the error of complaining to the head of the Boston Diocese, the arrogant Cardinal Bernard Law (Christopher Plummer), who turned a deaf ear to the claims and in some cases went so far as to tell the complainants that they, and not the priests, were somehow to blame. All the while, Law and his colleagues covered up the scandal through a series of covert transfers of the offending priests, allowing the perpetrators to continue their sexual activities with shocking impunity. The film also details a number of related subplots, including the plight of Mary Ryan (Ellen Burstyn), all of whose seven sons suffered from the priests abuse, and Father Spagnolia (Brian Dennehy), who dared to attack Laws handling of the scandal from his pulpit -- only to have the sexual skeletons in his own closet revealed.
