93,28136,Emergency Squad,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"This entry in the Italian crime film cycle of the 70s presents an interesting take on the format. Emergency Squad seems unusually postmodern for its time because it places an equal amount of dramatic focus on its hero and its villain. The hero part is fulfilled by Ravelli (Tomas Milian), a cop consumed with the desire to get revenge on the crook who shot his wife to death during a robbery. The crook in question is Marseilles (Gastone Moschin), who is trying to assemble funds for his own retirement. As the revenge scenario moves toward the inevitable confrontation, Emergency Squad retains interest because it paints both leads in a complex fashion -- Ravellis obsessive quest makes him as scary as he is sympathetic and the seemingly icy Marseilles reveals some surprisingly vulnerable sides to his character. Emergency Squad was the first of several Italian crime films for director Stelvio Massi, and star Tomas Milian would also become a mainstay of this genre. In 2005, Emergency Squad received a domestic DVD release from Mondo Macabro. ~ Donald Guarisco, Rovi",NR,"Action & Adventure, Art House & International",Stelvio Massi,N/A,N/A,"Tomás Milian, Gastone Moschin, Ray Lovelock"

The charm of the ""Eloise"" books has proven elusive whenever the property is adapted for another media, as witness a disastrous musical version which aired live on Playhouse 90 in 1956. On this occasion, Eloise came off as a spoiled obstreperous brat, which was as much the fault of the child actress cast in the role (Evelyn Rudie) as the adapters. Disney decided to give little Eloise another chance 47 years later with the location-filmed Eloise at the Plaza, a two-hour movie presentation of ABCs The Wonderful World of Disney anthology. This time around, Sofia Vassilieva played the title role, with Julie Andrews as Eloises nanny (something of a full-circle for Andrews, who won an Oscar for her portrayal of a rather different nanny in the 1964 Disney theatrical feature Mary Poppins). The plot finds Eloise insisting upon attending a debutante ball at the Plaza and further conniving to have a runaway foreign prince (Denis Akiyama) -- who isnt much older than she is -- as her escort. Our heroine also mends fences between a reluctant teenage deb and the girls pushy mother. Jeffrey Tambor is typecast as the Plazas supercilious concierge Mr. Salomone, whose dithering efforts to keep Eloise from nosing into other peoples business avail him not one bit.

Izzard takes a little bit of Robin Williams, a little bit of Jerry Seinfeld, even a little bit of Bob Newhart, but the final mix is absolutely his own and dizzily funny. Its not so much the subjects of his humor--though not many comics make jokes about classical mythology or evil giraffes--as it is the way he fluidly skips from thing to thing in a madcap free-associative whirl. He lulls you by seeming casual and almost sloppy, but when he needs to be precise his gestures and mimicry are razor sharp. There have been a million tired jokes made about trying to get a shower to stay at the right temperature, but Izzard manages to make even that funny. Hes even funnier when hes imitating Sean Connery as Noah, trying to convince God that a speedboat would make a much better photo opportunity than an ark, or playing a beekeeper flirting with someone passing on the street. Much of the giddiness comes from his astounding sense of spontaneity. Half the show seems to have been made up on the spot, and if it wasnt, you boggle wondering how he could have possibly written something so ridiculous and yet appropriate.

Circle, taken from his stand-up tour in 2000, doesnt have the astonishingly seamless free-associative flow of Glorious or Dress to Kill, his previous specials--which is to say, hes only intermittently brilliant, instead of supernaturally nonstop brilliant. Well take what we can get, because Izzard can slip in surprisingly stinging commentary about international politics and religion, yet his impish smile suggests that hes only pointing out the obvious. He tosses out an idea and then plays with it like a cat plays with a mouse, flipping it around, teasing it out, pouncing, and then letting it go, only to sneak back up on it just when youd forgetten it was there.

Saganne was first sent to a garrison town in North Africa before Colonel Dubreuilh (Philippe Noiret) assigned him to other missions, finally giving him a chance to exercise his innate ability to lead men. After a tragic hiatus in Paris where he fails to promote the colonialist cause, he returns to the Sahara and outshines his past accomplishments, leading a ragtag band of Arab dissidents in some brilliant military maneuvers -- for which he won the French Legion of Honor.

But the year is 1914 and Sagannes peaceful village idyll was not meant to endure -- he is again called off to war, and to his destiny. Even though the costuming, landscape, battles, and charisma of Depardieu as Saganne and Noiret as Colonel Dubreuilh are outstanding, and several subsidiary characters deliver emotionally compelling vignettes, the protagonists as an ensemble have not been scripted with much depth of character -- making the three-hour epic seem a bit too long in the end. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Classics, Drama, Romance",Alain Corneau,N/A,N/A,"Gérard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret, Catherine Deneuve"

They do not think he was killed by a lone gunman but by a mysterious cabal that somehow conspired to have him killed. How can this be? How can a crime this famous, witnessed and investigated by so many, remain a mystery? This is what veteran Australian police detective Colin McLaren is determined to find out. JFK: The Smoking Gun follows the forensic cold-case investigation McLaren conducted over four painstaking years, taking us back to that tragic day in Dallas at Dealey Plaza where the shooting took place, to Parkland Hospital where the president was pronounced dead, to the Bethesda Naval Hospital where the autopsy was conducted and to the conclusions of the Warren Commission that have remained controversial to this day. Driven by a seasoned police detective who, thanks to modern technology, finally had access to all the facts and to witness testimony, the documentary uses logic, reason and time-tested investigative techniques to solve a crime that is every bit as shocking and incredible today as it was when it first happened 50 years ago.

While taking shelter from a storm in a remote mansion, the detective and the young man stumble upon a mirrored room -- just like the one in Vinces dream. The frenzied Vince is nearly driven to suicide, but Detective Herlihy deduces that his friends nightmare was the handiwork of Lewis Belnap (Robert Emmett Keane), the mansions owner, who is a dabbler in hypnosis.

332,28502,Twins of Evil,N/A,79%,19,79%,1554,"This entry in Hammer Films long-running vampire series of the 60s and 70s is one of the most evocative and original. The story features voluptuous twin Playboy centerfolds Madeleine and Mary Collinson as sisters who, without parents, are sent to stay with their oppressive uncle (Peter Cushing, looking more emaciated than ever), who happens to live near the sinister Karnstein Castle, the locale of countless vampiric happenings in two prequels (The Vampire Lovers and Lust for a Vampire). One of the twins wanders over and meets the dashing Count Karstein (Damien Thomas), a vampire who later uses the girls blood to awaken his long-lost ancestor from the dead. Of course, the uncle predictably gives chase once trouble starts, but there is a clever plot twist as the count switches the twins before one is about to be burned at the stake for her supposed satanic involvements. Twins of Evil unabashedly exploits the twins assets to pump up the films sex appeal; it also seems to cater to viewers with a vampire fetish. Still, neither is necessarily a bad thing in a vampire film; Twins of Evil does create an effectively sensuous mood while also managing to sustain a fair amount of tension throughout the picture. Although Universal Pictures, the U.S. distributor, extracted nearly all of the flesh and bloodletting from its release, the original British cut retains everything and is the usual copy found on video. Like its predecessors, the script for Twins of Evil is loosely based on LeFanus classic vampire story Carmilla. ~ Jeremy Beday, Rovi",R,"Classics, Drama, Horror",John Hough,Universal,87 minutes,"Peter Cushing, Madeleine Collinson, Mary Collinson"

The similarities are not only cosmetic, however, as the film was co-written by Hammer stalwart Jimmy Sangster and co-stars studio regulars Peter Cushing, Miles Malleson, the dwarf Skip Martin, and Adrienne Corri (the future Clockwork Orange starlet who has a discreet nude scene here with German actress Kai Fischer). The ridiculous story concerns Jason, the young son of the notoriously decadent pervert Lord Netherton (Andrew Faulds), leader of Londons infamous sex den, the Hellfire Club. Jasons mother (Jean Lodge) flees with the child after he is viciously whipped for walking in on one of his fathers orgies. Many years later, his parents have died and Jason (Keith Michell) has become a Dutch circus acrobat, but decides to return to England to claim the ancestral mansion which is rightfully his. Posing as a coachman to his evil, perverse cousin Thomas (Peter Arne), whose oversight of the Hellfire Club has lifted its kinky membership into being the de facto power behind King George IIs rule, Jason tries to defeat the club, gain back his inheritance, and rescue his childhood love (Fischer), whom Thomas kidnaps. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi",NR,"Action & Adventure, Drama",,N/A,N/A,"Michael Balfour, Desmond Walter-Ellis, Andrew Faulds"

504,28753,The Outrage,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,"Derived from Rashomon, the classic 1951 Japanese film, The Outrage attempts to modernize the original story of rape and murder, transporting from medieval Japan to the American Southwest of the 1870s. The story is told within the framework of three men waiting at a railway station. A con-man (Edward G. Robinson) listens to the account of a trial held recently in the town as told by a prospector (Howard Da Silva) and a preacher (William Shatner) suffering from a crisis of faith in humanity. Three witnesses at the trial of a Mexican outlaw give conflicting testimony. Each version is shown in flashback. The outlaw, Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman), confesses that he bound the husband (Laurence Harvey), raped the wife, and killed the husband in a duel of honor. The wife (Claire Bloom) claims that the outlaw raped her, and then she stabbed her husband when he contemptuously blamed her for inviting the assault. The third witness, an old Indian (Paul Fix), declares that he found the dying husband who stated that he stabbed himself because he couldnt live with the humiliation. At this point, the narrative is interrupted by an abandoned babys cry. The child has gold hidden in his clothing which the con-man attempts to appropriate. Then the discussion of the trial continues, turning brusquely from drama to parody. The prospector admits that he witnessed the rape, but that the wife nagged the two men into fighting over her. The husband tripped and fell on his own knife. The prospector, who stole the jeweled knife from the dead body, chose not to appear in court. Possibly out of some desire for redemption, the prospector decided to care for the abandoned baby, and the preacher regains faith from the supposed altruistic action. The eerily deserted train station and the strong black-and-white cinematography contribute a mild surreal quality to the film, but can do little to save the story from its flaws. The changes in the characters necessary to accommodate the new setting cause them to lose important symbolic significance in the translation. Despite a star cast and strong acting, the new version is mediocre at best. The Outrage falls woefully short of the acclaimed Japanese original.",NR,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama, Mystery & Suspense, Western",Martin Ritt,Warner Home Video,95 minutes,"Paul Newman, Laurence Harvey, Claire Bloom"

Meanwhile, a group of senators attempts to deflect public attention from themselves by holding a series of hearings on sexual excesses in American society. They decide to scapegoat ""The Happy Hooker"" for her well-publicized exploits, and she is subpoenaed as a hostile witness in their crusade against loose values. Though Xaviera isnt concerned, her attorney (George Hamilton) warns her that vital issues of censorship and personal freedom are at stake. They fly to Washington D.C., where Xavieras irreverent testimony breathes some life into the stuffy proceedings. She tweaks the sensibilities of the senators (David White, Phil Foster, Jack Carter and Ray Walston) and holds their hypocrisy up to the daylight. Halfway through the hearings, Xaviera is kidnapped by an undercover CIA agent (Billy Barty) and pressed into service for her country. She is secretly sent to Miami to seduce a politically important (and impotent) Arabian sheik (Jerry Fischer), and while doing her duty discovers the missing hooker among his harem. Xaviera returns to Washington and triumphantly discredits the senate sub-committee by exposing its members as perverts and white slavers, thus saving erotic freedom for Americans everywhere. Joe E.

Despite the many legal, ethical and moral issues raised by the offer, the grieving couple, after much soul searching, accept Wells proposal, placing them in a sort of Faustian pact with the doctor.

They are judged sane and released 18 years later, whereupon they take up residence at an old farm. Edmunds daughter Jackie lives in the city, where she tries to take care of her wild sister Debbie (Kim Butcher), visiting only occasionally and not suspecting a thing. It isnt until Jackies new psychiatrist boyfriend Graham (Paul Greenwood) starts poking around that she learns the truth. The truth is that Dorothy, far from cured, is drawing people to her home -- through classified ads promising Tarot readings -- and murdering them with metal pokers, electric drills and pitchforks. Not only that, but young Debbie turns out to be a chip off the old butcher-block herself, leading to a gory and harrowing finale. Sheila Keith is outstanding as the crazed Dorothy, and Davies is similarly terrific in a low-key turn as her doting husband, turning a blind eye to his beloveds homicidal lunacy until it is far too late to stop it. A creepy, entertaining bloodbath, Frightmare is highly recommended for horror fans. This 1974 film was rereleased on video in the U.S. during the early 80s and named Frightmare II to advertise it as the sequel to an unrelated film, the 1983 Frightmare directed by Norman Thaddeus Vane. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi","R (sex, violence)",Horror,Ash Smith,Spartan Home Entertainment,87 minutes,"Shanda Besler, Summer Lapan, Shawn Wright"

The Prince is a political liberal who wishes to arrange things so that the Emperor will arrest him, creating a public scandal which will provide a rallying point for the opposition. Instead, when the expected troops come, Rudolfs sensuous friends loyally ward off the Imperial officers, humiliating them in the process. The result is that the guests, the Prince and a hermaphrodite friend are killed by newly arrived Imperial reinforcements, and the now-familiar official story of murder and suicide is concocted for public consumption. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi",NR,Drama,Miklós Jancsó,N/A,N/A,"Lajos Balazsovits, Pamela Villoresi, Franco Branciaroli"

Duke Holliday (Robert Mitchum), an American army lieutenant, is on his way to Mexico by boat when hes confronted in his cabin by Blake (William Bendix), gun in hand, who plans on taking him back to the United States. Holliday gets away, pummeling Blake pretty hard in the bargain and stealing his identification, and crosses paths with Joan Graham (Jane Greer). It turns out that shes looking for the same man he is, a smooth-talking hood and grifter named Fiske (Patric Knowles), who took Holliday at gunpoint for 300,000 dollars in army payroll money and Graham for 2,000 dollars, in addition to her hand in marriage. They spend a lot of their time sizing each other up, not knowing how much to believe about the other while trying to catch up with Fiske, while Blake -- an army captain whos after Holliday for his alleged part in the robbery -- stumbles along a step or two behind them. These four end up playing cat-and-mouse across Veracruz, with Fiske always a half-step ahead, while police Inspector General Ortega (Ramon Novarro) calmly keeps tabs on all of them, trying to figure out (along with the rest of us) exactly who is on the level (in those days, especially after Out of the Past, there was no built-in assurance for audiences that Mitchum and Greer played characters with clean hands, and Mitchum is almost too good with the rough stuff here to be an obvious hero). Holliday and Graham engage in some surprisingly playful and suggestive banter during their travels, in between her keeping Holliday -- whose command of Spanish is less than minimal -- from adding too many new permutations to the phrase ""the ugly American"" in his dealings with the Mexicans. The mood is decidedly brisk and light-hearted at times, given the gunplay and violence that explodes at key intervals. The addition of John Qualen -- in one of the strangest roles of his career -- as a decidedly fidgety and neurotic presence in the last quarter of the story only adds to the undertone of quirkiness in this superb film noir.",NR,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama, Mystery & Suspense",Don Siegel,RKO Radio Pictures,72 minutes,"Robert Mitchum, William Bendix, Jane Greer"

The disgruntled Tony retreats to his yacht, where he finds himself saddled with a reluctant passenger -- Josephine. The two spend the rest of the picture getting on each others nerves, until at the very last moment they realize theyre still madly in love after all. Clearly inspired by It Happened One Night (the twist being that the girl is poor and the boy is rich), Vagabond Lady is a minor but agreeable entry in the screwball-comedy genre.

Baker, best-known in America for her starring role in the controversial Baby Doll, stars as Martha Cauldwell, who was struck mute when she saw her parents die in a railroad accident at the age of 12. She was taken in by a family in Martinique, and her cousin Jenny Ascot (Ida Galli appearing as ""Evelyn Stewart"") comes to visit her as the story begins. Jenny is murdered shortly thereafter, and the police tie her death to the sex killing of a teenaged girl a few hours earlier. The prime suspect is a local hippie whom the locals believe to be a drug-addled Satanist. This touch, similar to the persecution of suspected witch Florinda Bolkan in Lucio Fulcis Non Si Sevizia un Paperino -- released the same year -- is reinforced by a scene involving a Donald Duck toy which suggests that the similarities between the two films arent entirely coincidental (that films original Italian title translates as ""Dont Torture Donald Duck,"" later changed to Dont Torture a Duckling to avoid copyright issues). At any rate, the hippie is arrested but exonerated after two more murders occur while he is in jail, and so the other suspects (including Franco Fantasia as an unctuous doctor, Eduardo Fajardo as a sinister chauffeur, and Jorge Rigaud as the occultist uncle) fall under suspicion. The usual internal rivalries and family secrets are punctuated by numerous close-ups of characters eyes (another Fulci trademark) and various occult red herrings, only to end up in a fairly predictable -- if highly improbable -- secular conclusion.

Yegor Prokudin (Vasili Shukshin) is an orphan who grew up in a criminal gang. While he was free, he did not lose his innocent, joyful heart, but many years in prison have taken away his joy in living. The film opens on the occasion of his release from prison.

Katharine Hepburn and Doris Nolan play Linda and Julia Seton, two daughters of a very well-to-do family. Linda feels a bit lost in the shuffle as sister Julia prepares to marry self-made financier Cary Grant. Hepburn has always rebelled against her privileged trappings, and finds a kindred spirit in the unorthodox, iconoclastic Grant. On the verge of compromising his down-to-earth values with his marriage to the wealth-obsessed Nolan, Grant chooses instead to plight his troth with soul-mate Hepburn, celebrating his ""liberation"" by doing several cartwheels. Donald Ogden Stewart is careful to bring the pre-Depression frivolities of the Barry play up-to-date, first by changing the character of Grants best friend (played in both films by Edward Everett Horton) from a lazy socialite to a dedicated professor, and by including several lines indicating how out of touch the privileged classes are--and choose to remain--with 1930s realities. The only element in which the remake does not improve on the original is in the casting of Hepburns alcoholic younger brother; charming though Lew Ayres is in the 1938 film, he is still outclassed by Monroe Owsley in Holiday (1930). Katharine Hepburn managed to temporarily defray her ""box office poison"" onus when Holiday proved to be a success; alas, her next film, Bringing Up Baby (which reteamed her with Grant), was a financial bust, compelling her to return to Broadway--where she made a spectacular comeback in another Philip Barry play, +The Philadelphia Story.",NR,"Classics, Comedy, Drama, Romance",George Cukor,Sony Repertory,96 minutes,"Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Doris Nolan"

While interviews with the teens show they are dreaming of making it big and living free, their reality and their naive bravado lend a pathos to their existence that is difficult to behold. Adult viewers will be well aware that their chances for survival are low, and their chances of staying out of prison worse. Rat is a 17-year-old petty criminal who would like to go back to school or join the army, though these statements are not exactly convincing. Among his friends are Dewayne, who visits his father in prison in a poignant scene; Tiny, a 14-year-old prostitute whose mother is in denial about her daughter; two other hookers, Kim (16 years old) and Shellie (13); and a 19-year-old lesbian who has a strong sense of self-preservation. The families of these teens have either thrown them out of the house or are otherwise alienated from their lives, and the only adults who enter the picture as supportive figures are social workers, doctors, and in some cases, the police themselves who do what they can to make life less difficult for the youngsters. No remedies are suggested to mend the situation, and no judgments made on the teens or their families.",R,"Documentary, Special Interest",Martin Bell,N/A,N/A,"Kim, Lulu"

Winner of numerous awards, including Best Feature Documentary at New Yorks NewFest 2010 and the Cadillac Peoples Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival 2009 The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls tells the story of the worlds only comedic, singing, yodeling lesbian twin sisters, Lynda and Jools Topp, whose political activism and unique brand of entertainment has helped change New Zealands social landscape. In the process they have become well-loved cultural icons. The film will open in New York at Cinema Village on May 13. Other cities will follow. This is the first time that the irrepressible Kiwi entertainment double act, Jools and Lynda Topps extraordinary personal story has been told. As well as rarely seen archive footage and home movies, the film features a series of special interviews with some of the Topps infamous comedy alter-egos including candid chats with the two Kens, Camp Mother and Camp Leader, the Bowling Ladies and the Posh Socialite sisters, Prue and Dilly. The Topp Twins have attained a unique status within New Zealand culture, and their fans range from hard core political activists, to sheep farmers and Ladies who Lunch. Their ability to relate to all kinds of people, and their natural gift for humour, has helped them cross from the fringes to the mainstream. It has often been said that if the story of the Twins was fictional nobody would believe it. From rural backwaters to busking on the streets of Auckland, to performances at the Rugby World Cup and Londons West End stage, their appeal is infectious. From support act to Split Enz, Billy Bragg, and Midnight Oil to headlining their own hugely successful tours in Australia, Canada, the USA and Britain. The twins have morphed from radical activists into Kiwi national treasures, cultural ambassadors, and finally, according to the Glasgow Herald, into New Zealands finest artistic export since lamb cutlets! The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls follows the girls from their happy childhood on a Waikato dairy farm - where they grew up singing to the cows - to the Territorial Army where they quickly became the Vera Lynns of their battalion. They came of age performing on the streets of Auckland during the heady days of the political protest marches in the early 80s, and quickly joined the forefront of progressive social change campaigning for a Nuclear-Free NZ, Maori Land Rights, a halt to the1981 Springbok Tour, and Homosexual Law Reform. By 1998 only a decade later, Lynda Topp, as Camp Mother, came close to winning the mayoral elections in Auckland, and the Topp Twins were firmly entrenched in the bosom of Kiwi culture with their own prime time TV Series Do Not Adjust Your Twinset. The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls is not just the story of two sisters but also of 50 years of New Zealand history. Half a century of cultural changes and the foundation of a national identity. Part concert film, part biopic, part historical record, part comedy, the Twins share their journey from ""coming out‟ to Jools recent brush with Breast Cancer with much laughter, honesty and wisdom. It is a film about two truly unique New Zealanders, which ends up saying as much about us as it does about them. The Topp Twins: Untouchable Girls is directed by award-winning ex BBC documentary filmmaker, Leanne Pooley. Director of Photography role was shared by Leon Narbey (Whale Rider); one of New Zealands most acclaimed cinematographers, and Wayne Vinten, (Best Cinematography NZ Screen Awards 2008).

The hardscrabble founders, the Ponce family, have lived and performed on the back roads of Mexico since the 19th century.

Late that year, the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Greenwich Village was stormed by police and its patrons arrested -- resulting in two days of rioting. Allen Ginsberg and other celebrities talk about past police tactics, witch-hunts, censorship, and historical ""cleansing"" operations that violated human rights and civil liberties -- such as routing gays and lesbians out of the State Department. A certain openness about sexual preferences started appearing in the 1920s and accelerated during World War II, eventually culminating in the organized movements of the 1960s and later demanding an end to discrimination. Older and younger generations of gays and lesbians present different viewpoints on a variety of topics, and conflicts or disagreements between gays and lesbians are outlined. The seriousness of the subject of discrimination is balanced with humor, which makes this documentary more accessible to straight audiences unfamiliar with the topic. ~ Eleanor Mannikka, Rovi",NR,"Documentary, Drama, Special Interest",Greta Schiller,First Run Features,87 minutes,"Rita Mae Brown, Robert Bruce Nugent, Harry Otis"

But what was he like before he formed the Nazi party? Screenwriter and director Menno Meyjes explores that question in this drama, a work of fiction keyed to the fact that Hitler unsuccessfully pursued a career as an artist following World War I. In 1918, Max Rothman (John Cusack) is a former artist who lost an arm during the war. While Max can no longer create, his eye for talent is as keen as ever, so he has become a successful art dealer, specializing in Modernists such as George Grosz. Maxs success has brought him a fine home and a beautiful wife, Nina (Molly Parker); hes also acquired a mistress, Liselore (Leelee Sobieski), a lovely young woman with artistic aspirations of her own. One day, Max meets Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor), an emotionally intense, fellow war veteran who has found himself penniless in Munich. Adolf fancies himself an artist, and while Max isnt especially impressed with his technique, he sees in him a burning passion and a desire to communicate, so he encourages Adolf to express his demons through his art. While Adolf takes Maxs advice to heart and strikes up a friendship with him, Maxs friends find Adolfs open advocation of anti-Semitism rather troubling; Max, who is Jewish, simply chalks Adolfs attitudes up to unpleasant wartime experiences. But as Adolf immerses himself more deeply into his political interests and his thoughts on social engineering, he begins to leave painting behind in favor of a more interesting art form, the political arena.

Stuart Blacktons The Battle Cry of Peace, D.W. Griffiths Intolerance and Thomas Inces Civilization. Set in the mythical kingdom of Wredpryd, Civilization begins with war spreading through the land. Inventor Count Ferdinand (Howard Hickman), against the wishes of his pacifist fiancee (Enid Markey), agrees to commandeer a submarine against the enemy. When his sub blows up, the Count is rescued from eternal damnation by the spirit of Jesus Christ, whose soul enters Ferdinands body. Ferdinand returns to life, convincing the King of Wredpryd (Herchel Mayal) that he, the king, has divine powers. But Jesus, using Ferdinand as his vessel, shows the king that no man is above the laws of God--and also gives him an up-close-and-personal tour of the bloody battlefield. The King realizes the error of his ways, and declares an end to the battle. Extremely popular during its first year of release (1916), Civilization disappeared from view the moment that the US declared war against Germany.

He continues to explore challenges to the human spirit, teaming here with cerebral palsy victim Heather Rose whose small role in de Heers Bad Boy Bubby (1993) led to her interest in filmmaking. The wheelchair-bound Rose, who cannot walk, feed or dress herself, communicates via her computerized electronic voice synthesizer. She overcame these obstacles to collaborate with writer Frederick Stahl on this drama, created the lead role of Julia for herself, and brought the project to de Heer. Julias sympathetic lesbian sister Rix (Rena Owen) is not in a position to take care of her siblings needs. Instead, Julia depends on an abusive, short-tempered caretaker Madelaine (Joey Kennedy), who calls Julia a ""spastic,"" abandons her on the toilet, leaves the wheels locked on the wheelchair, and devises further torment by forcing Julia to watch her intimacies with a parade of boyfriends. This pattern heads in a different direction after Julia bumps her wheelchair into Eddie (John Brumpton), who becomes her companion. But Julia wants love and sex, not just companionship -- and Madelaine is jealous. The 30-day shoot sometimes worked around Roses usual routines, as de Heer explained, ""Lunch takes her two hours, and theres no way you can make it go faster...The nature of response is different, the nature of physical handling is different, the nature of set-up time is different...Its impossible to overstate the courage of the performance you see on the screen. Rose somehow found the means to respond on cue, to maintain the concentration, to move in the desired direction, all the myriad of acting fundamentals we take for granted as normal things in our normal lives.""

The story is set beneath Buenos Aires, deep within its labyrinthine subway system, and centers on a train containing 30 riders that has mysteriously disappeared (much like political dissidents tend to ""vanish"" in Argentina). The subway officials are greatly troubled and so call in topographer Daniel Pratt to help them find it. Unfortunately, the tunnel system is so vast and complex, that Pratt must find his mentor Hugo Mistein for help. Unfortunately, he too has disappeared. Fortunately, he left the system plans behind and as Daniel studies them, he comes to the awful realization that the train, which can be heard but not seen, has somehow become trapped in a fourth dimension. His findings attract the attention of local bureaucrats who are too rigid and pragmatic to accept Pratts outlandish theory.

In between and around these two polar opposite successes of his early career, Ellison rails and laughs, berates and curses, and generally has a great deal of fun launching his barbs at a multitude of targets, including himself, as often as not. One eerie aspect of watching him across this fast-paced account, which covers many decades of his life, is realizing how much Ellison resembles the late actor George Grizzard as he looked and sounded from the 1960s to the 21st century -- if there was an actor who mightve portrayed this unique personality in a dramatic context, it was Grizzard. But much more important than any such mundane observations is the keen appreciation that the filmmaker has for his subject, sufficient to take us on what amounts to a cinematic roller-coaster ride across one part of Ellisons psyche. Thats how its paced, and that how its best to take in this delightfully quirky and lively nonfiction film. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest",,N/A,N/A,"Harlan Ellison, Robin Williams, Neil Gaiman"

Finally free from his captors, Cassel joins the resistance with his loyal pal Brasseur.

Though punctuated by his trademark kinetic camera work, this moody gothic horror film has the sort of brittle formalism more common in Japanese domestic dramas of the 1940s and 1950s. Dr. Yukio Daitokuji (Masahiro Motoki) is a well-to-do doctor living in a wealthy neighborhood located near a shantytown. He lives in a gorgeous old house along with his father, mother, and beautiful young wife Rin (Ryo). The couple seems happy, but Rins lack of a past, due to amnesia, is a source of anxiety for the socially conscious doctor. The rigid respectability of the couples upstanding bourgeois life shatters when a bizarre rag-wearing man kills off Daitokujis parents in sudden and gruesome manners. The terror gets ratcheted up a notch when the mysterious assailant throws Daitokuji into a deep well on the family grounds and then reveals himself to be physically identical to the young doctor. The stranger assumes Daitokujis identity by making passionate love with his wife and threatening to kill his patients. Tsukamoto brilliantly juxtaposes the oppressive opulence of the upper class, characterized by deathly silences and Kubrick-like compositions, with the grubby, desperate world of the slums, whose residents could have populated The Road Warrior (1981). While Tsukamotos fascination with revenge, doppelgangers, and male rage, as seen in Tokyo Fist (1995) and Bullet Ballet (1998), are clearly present in this work, it also showcases the directors growing stylistic maturity. This film was screened at the 1999 Toronto Film Festival. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi",R,"Art House & International, Horror, Mystery & Suspense",Shin'ya Tsukamoto,Saiko,84 minutes,"Masahiro Motoki, Ryô, Yasutaka Tsutsui"

It took the lives of many of their loved ones and has left them with physical and emotional scars that may never heal. However, what the war could never take from them was their music. Through music The Refugee All Stars have found a place of refuge, a sense of purpose and a source of power. The feature length documentary film THE REFUGEE ALL STARS follows the band over the course of three years as they make their way from the refugee camps back to their homes in the war-ravaged country of Sierra Leone.

François Truffaut originally wrote and directed this short, about a girl trying to get to Paris from the flooded outlying countryside, but decided not to finish it. He gave the footage to Jean-Luc Godard, who re-edited it and added his own narration. The young woman, simply known as Elle (Caroline Dim), must first get out of her house, balancing on boards and exposed spots of land. She meets a young man, Lui (Jean-Claude Brialy), who offers her a ride in his car. The action concentrates on their physical comedy, conversation, and Godards lightly philosophical commentary and their screwball journey becomes a celebration of intelligent fun. Truffaut makes great wide-angle use of the actually flooded Parisian countryside of the time. The structure, the narration, the striking open/claustrophobic visual style all work perfectly and in playful tone the short is a precursor to Bande à part.

That is, except for Giacomo DiNorscio, aka Jackie Dee (Vin Diesel), a longtime Lucchese family ""mechanic"" implicated in everything from kidnapping to drug dealing.

Sean Kierney (Linus Roache), the prosecutor tackling the Lucchese Family case, tries repeatedly to persuade Jackie Dee to testify against his partners in exchange for leniency, but he stubbornly refuses. Tired of the way things are being handled, Jackie Dee informs family attorney Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage) that he intends to represent himself in court; this seemingly suicidal move turns into an unexpected success as Jackie Dees sense of humor and streetwise charm has a remarkable impact on the judge and jury.

In 1968, Lincoln High School honor student Paula Crisostomo (Alexa Vega), outraged at the shabby treatment afforded Chicano students in the L.A. school system -- including habitually lowered expectations, poor facilities, a total absence of bilingual courses or textbooks, unfairly administered penalties for slight infractions, demeaning corporal punishment, and out-of-hand refusal to write letters of recommendation to choice colleges -- challenges the authority of her elders for the first time in her life by organizing a mass student walkout at five barrio high schools. Mentored by dedicated young teacher Sal Castro (Michael Pena), Paula and her fellow student activists intend to make their protest a peaceful one, but the L.A. cops typically use brute force to quell the ""radicals."" Even when it seems that the school board will capitulate to the Chicano students demands, the kids are betrayed (theres an undercover police officer in their midst) and the leaders of the walkout are threatened with lengthy prison sentences on trumped-up ""conspiracy"" charges. It will not spoil the ending of the film to reveal that the students are ultimately successful; as directed by actor Edward James Olmos (who also plays one of the school board members), the dramatic thrust of the story is the lasting effect that the protest has on its participants -- especially the idealistic Paula Crisostomo. Executive producer Moctesuma Esparza, whod been one of the original walkout organizers back in 1968, spent a full two decades getting this story on film; Esparza is played by Bodie Olmos, son of the director, while Esparzas daughter Tonantzin Esparza is seen as Vickie Castro. Also, Paula Crisostomos daughter Marisol Crisostomo-Romo is seen as Mita -- and in addition, several of the former student activists are interviewed during the closing credits, or appear as extras in the crowd scenes.

Swift and decisive action was needed from the Italian government, and Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, hoping to win back the good will of the people following a number of embarrassing scandals, used the LAquila earthquake as an opportunity to burnish his reputation. Berlusconi pledged to rebuild LAquila, and to bring global attention to the citys troubles he arranged for the G8 Summit to be moved from Sardinia to LAquila. However, Italys Civil Protection Agency, an organization designed to deal with public crises, is run by one of Berlusconis cronies, Guido Bertolaso, who was also plagued by scandal, and together they used their power to channel emergency monies to their colleagues without public oversight. Meanwhile, over two thirds of those displaced by the LAquila earthquake are still waiting for new housing, many havent even been able to return to the city, and no one knows when or if the great city will ever return to its former glory.

Southpaw is the story of Francis Barrett, a lad from the marginalized Travellers community of western Ireland, who within fifteen months worked his way from the junior league of boxing to represent Ireland in the Atlanta Olympic Games. Francis began training with a local coach, Chick Gillon, as a young boy. Lacking proper training facilities, let alone electricity and running water at home, Francis early developed a fighting spirit and the talent and ambition to match. More importantly, he got a great deal of love and support from his large family and Chick, a true mentor. The filmmakers continually crosscut between fighting and family, both integral elements of Franciss persona. When he speaks of his fellow Travellers feeling ashamed when they are refused service, we see it in his Southpaw punch. Barrett chronicler and insightful sports writer Tom Humphries claims that ""Ireland wanted him to conform to the working class,"" while Francis felt that what the Olympics could do was bring respect to his people. By the films end, coaches and supporters who do not hail from his area claim the only way for him to win in Sydney and beyond is to leave his past behind: ""He must decide that he is a boxer first, Traveller second.""

But to do that, it must first carry us back to 1930, when Winston Churchill was at the low point of a three-decade political career; still holding a seat in Parliament but out of the government and also out of favor with the leadership of the British Conservative Party, he was in isolation -- political, social, and personal -- for much of the decade that followed. In the intervening years, he wrote and spoke with ever-increasing fervor against the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Germany, a lone voice in a complacent or oblivious world. Eventually, he was brought back into the government begrudgingly by the Conservative Party leadership as First Lord of the Admiralty. And after a decade in isolation, he became the reluctant choice of both King George VI and the outgoing prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, to succeed the latter.Combining his writing ability -- perhaps the most formidable of anyone in government anywhere in the English-speaking world -- and his best moral and political instincts, and one of the best speaking voices in the public life of the era, Churchill became an inspiring figure, both at home and abroad over the ensuing 18 months. Coupled with the near-miraculous success of the evacuation of British and French forces from Dunkirk in the wake of the military disaster in France, his presence became a rallying point for anti-Nazis on both sides of the Atlantic, helping to turn the isolationist tide in American politics amid the turmoil of Franklin Roosevelts unprecedented run for a third presidential term. All the while, Churchill was also facing daily new threats from an emboldened Germany, now based directly across the English Channel and presumed to be planning an imminent invasion.Tranks movie, bound together with narration by Sir Ben Kingsley, weaves these and many other threads -- including an oddly understated yet suitably relevant one regarding Churchills connection to Jews in England -- together in a focused account of those 20 treacherous months, and the results are engrossing even to those familiar with most of the material covered. ~ Bruce Eder, Rovi",NR,Documentary,Richard Trank,Moriah Films,101 minutes,Ben Kingsley
