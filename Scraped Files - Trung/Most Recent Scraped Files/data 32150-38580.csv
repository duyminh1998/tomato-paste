As any high-school English student can tell you,the original 1945 novel was Orwells spin on the rise and fall of the Communist myth. A group of intelligent animals overthrow their corrupt human owner and set up their own self-sustained farm, predicated on an idealistic credo: ""All Animals are Created Equal"", ""No Animal Shall Ever Drink Liquor"", ""Four Legs Good: Two Legs Bad"" etc. But when Snowball the Pig (read: Trotsky) is overthrown by the despotic Napoleon (read: Stalin), all idealism goes out the window, and soon the pigs are ruling dictatorially over the other animals. Before long, Animal Farm operates on but one principle: ""All Animals Are Created Equal, But Some Are More Equal Than Others."" Orwells ironic ending, in which it becomes impossible to tell the difference between the Pigs and the Humans, is blunted in favor of a grafted-on happy ending, perhaps to mollify the kiddie trade.

Eventually, Miles proves his mettle by squelching a plan to oust King Henry IV Ian Keith from the throne of England. On a more personal level, Miles carries on a romance with Mackworths daughter Lady Anne Janet Leigh, while Miles sister Meg Barbara Rush finds happiness in the arms of knight-in-training Francis Gascoyne Craig Hill. The heavy of the piece is the Earl of Alban David Farrar, whom Miles must ultimately face down in a well-directed climactic set-to.

He works with some of the most distinguished institutes of learning and research in the world, and is presently helping the military launch an orbital space platform vital to the security of the country -- and he can get personal telephone access to the President of the United States on less than five minutes notice, if the need arises. But his home life is less fulfilling -- he and his loving wife Mary (Diane Brewster) work hard to make a good home, but their 10-year-old son Timmie (Richard Eyer) is more interested in making mischief than studying, and cant be motivated to learn even basic math. Desperate to show him the importance of mathematics, Dr. Merrinoe takes Timmie to his place of work. Unbeknownst to him, however, while the boy is left alone in the lab, the super-computer implants a hypnotic suggestion in Timmies mind. Suddenly, Timmie shows astonishing skills in chess, as well as both electronics and mathematics, and the first task he accomplishes, apart from beating his father in chess, is to assemble the pieces of a robot that Tom and his colleagues had written off as a pile of useless junk -- supposedly, according to Toms now-deceased predecessor, the robot and its plans were brought back from the twenty-third century. That mechanical man is none other than Robby The Robot, previously seen in Forbidden Planet -- and suddenly, the boy and the robot are playing pranks and going on adventures together, Robby even providing a way for the boy to turn invisisble, which allows him to get even with one bully at school and to spy on his parents, for which he is soundly punished. But amid the seemingly light-hearted mischief with which he assists the boy, the mechanical man sometimes seems to be following two sets of orders, one from Timmie, and one, a lot more quietly, from the super-computer. Ultimately, the computer and the robot join forces in a plot to take over the space platform and rule the world -- with Timmie held hostage in orbit, and threatened with a slow, painful death unless his father agrees to serve the computer.",G,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Science Fiction & Fantasy",Herman Hoffman,MGM,85 minutes,"Richard Eyer, Diane Brewster, Philip Abbott"

96,32286,"Come On, Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story",nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"Like many other made-for-TV biopics inspired by popular television series of yore, Come on Get Happy: The Partridge Family Story offers the spectacle of actors playing other actors playing different characters--and as such, those ""characters"" come off as more interesting than the ""real"" actors. Focusing exclusively on the five years (1970-1974) that The Partridge Family was in production, the story is told from the viewpoint of Danny Bonaduce (played by a pre-Desperate Housewives) Shawn Pyfrom), and accordingly is colored by the sentiments so often expressed by the real, irrepressibly outspoken Bonaduce. Upon landing the coveted role of Danny Partridge, young Bonaduce must contend with the jealousy of his abusive father Joseph (William Russ); all the while, Danny is a sidelines observer of the effect that overnight stardom has on his coworker David Cassidy (Keith Partridge), who (it says here) despises all the idolatry and yearns for a normal life. Rather touchingly, the film recounts the surrogate son-surrogate father relationship between Danny and actor Dave Madden (Michael Chieffo), who was genuinely fond of his younger costars despite the kid-hating irascibility of his ""Reuben Kincaid"" character. The films highlight, which would be impossible to belief if it wasnt corroborated by witnesses, is the episode wherein Cassidy impulsively ""kidnaps"" Danny, whereupon both boys head off on a short journey of self-discovery; less easy to swallow is the scene which contrives a feud between the ""Partridge"" cast and the actors on the rival series The Brady Bunch (who are, interestingly enough, identified only by their character names and not their real names).

Using clips of such subjects as the Congo in the early 60s, atomic blasts from 1956, a celebrity visit by Sophia Loren to an eel festival, and exploitation of workers at a Fiat plant - accompanied by a prose poem, authored by Pasolini and then read by him on the soundtrack - Pasolini speaks out against bigotry, intolerance, middle-class hypocrisies, human complacency and a host of other ills that concerned him. His unusual method of juxtaposing unrelated images (and short-circuiting the audiences reactions in this way) anticipates his contributions to Dusan Makavejevs Sweet Movie in the mid-1970s, which employs similar associative techniques but waxes far more shocking. This film incurred a massive amount of trouble almost immediately after it went into production; its original producer, Gastone Ferrante, had the wild and antagonistic idea of turning the project into an episode film, of which Pasolinis segment would constitute 1/2; Ferrante asked the ultra-rightwing ideologue Giovanni Guareschi to do the other half, planning to ""pit"" the two halves against one another in the same program. This, of course, drew ire from Pasolini, who so detested Guareschis philosophies that he wanted nothing to do with the conservative. The picture was nevertheless released as planned, to dismal box office draws, and thereafter disappeared for 45 years. In 2008, a second, ""reconstructed"" version emerged (33 years after Pasolinis murder) and played at the Venice Film Festival, minus the Guareschi elements; retitled La Rabbia di Pasolini, it was supervised by Giuseppe Bertolucci, who receives co-directing credit with Pasolini and does a two-minute filmed introduction.",NR,"Art House & International, Documentary","Pier Paolo Pasolini, Giuseppe Bertolucci",nothing,nothing,"Giuseppe Bertolucci, Pier Paolo Pasolini"

Katharine Hepburn and Doris Nolan play Linda and Julia Seton, two daughters of a very well-to-do family.

Hepburn has always rebelled against her privileged trappings, and finds a kindred spirit in the unorthodox, iconoclastic Grant. On the verge of compromising his down-to-earth values with his marriage to the wealth-obsessed Nolan, Grant chooses instead to plight his troth with soul-mate Hepburn, celebrating his ""liberation"" by doing several cartwheels. Donald Ogden Stewart is careful to bring the pre-Depression frivolities of the Barry play up-to-date, first by changing the character of Grants best friend (played in both films by Edward Everett Horton) from a lazy socialite to a dedicated professor, and by including several lines indicating how out of touch the privileged classes are--and choose to remain--with 1930s realities. The only element in which the remake does not improve on the original is in the casting of Hepburns alcoholic younger brother; charming though Lew Ayres is in the 1938 film, he is still outclassed by Monroe Owsley in Holiday (1930). Katharine Hepburn managed to temporarily defray her ""box office poison"" onus when Holiday proved to be a success; alas, her next film, Bringing Up Baby (which reteamed her with Grant), was a financial bust, compelling her to return to Broadway--where she made a spectacular comeback in another Philip Barry play, +The Philadelphia Story.",NR,"Classics, Comedy, Drama, Romance",George Cukor,Sony Repertory,96 minutes,"Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Doris Nolan"

Domenikoss father, however, attempts to lead a political rebellion on the island, which forces the young painter to be shuttled off to Venice and away from the young lass. Once there, his path intersects not only with the famed artist Titian (Sotiris Moustakas) but Nino de Guevara (Juan Diego Botto), a Spanish priest with not-so-subtle homosexual designs on this new arrival.

We open on the now-famous scenes of a remote, burning desert fort, manned by the dead Foreign Legionnaires, then flash back to the early lives of the Geste brothers. As children, the Gestes swear eternal loyalty to one another and to their family. One of the boys, young Beau (played as a youth by Donald OConnor), witnesses his beloved aunt (Heather Thatcher) apparently stealing a valuable family jewel in order to finance the Geste home; Beau chooses to remain silent rather than disgrace his aunt. Years later, the grown Beau (Gary Cooper) again protects his aunt by confessing to the theft and running off to join the Foreign Legion. He is joined in uniform by faithful brothers John (Ray Milland) and Digby (Robert Preston), who in turn are pursued by a slimy thief (J. Carroll Naish). The crook is in cahoots with sadistic Legion Sgt. Markov (Brian Donlevy, in one of the most hateful portrayals ever captured on celluloid), who is later put in charge of Fort Zinderneuf, where Beau and John are stationed. When the Arabs attack, Markov proves himself a valiant soldier; it is he who hits upon the idea of convincing the Arabs that the fort is still fully manned by propping up the corpses of the casualties at the guard posts. Beau is seriously wounded, and while the greedy Markov searches for the jewel supposedly hidden on Beaus person, he is held at bay by loyal John. The suddenly enervated Beau kills Markov, then dies himself--but not before entrusting two notes to John, one of which requests that John give Beau the ""Viking funeral"" hed always wanted (this is why the fort is in flames at the beginning of the film). After the battle, Digby Geste, a bugler with the relief troops, comes upon Beaus dead body, and appropriates the notes. As it turns out, John Geste is the only one who survives to return to England. He gives his aunt Beaus letter, which explains why Beau had confessed and run off--""a beau geste, indeed"" comments his tearful aunt. No one missed nominal leading lady Susan Hayward in this essentially all-male entertainment. For years available only in muddily processed or truncated versions, Beau Geste was restored to its pristine glory by the American Film Institute in the late 1980s.",PG,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama",William Wellman,Paramount Pictures,114 minutes,"Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston"

Vowing revenge on the society which put him behind bars, Terry Hawkins (Steven Morrison) begins making pornographic films for a group of rich decadents, who watch them at orgies. When the jaded Steve (Alex Kregar) complains of boredom, he is kidnapped by Hawkins and his Charles Manson-like gang. The crazed killers force Steve to suck a deers hoof which a leather-freak named Ken (Dennis Crawford) has placed in his zipper, then they show a snuff film of his friend Nancy (Barbara Amunsen) being murdered. In the film, Nancys face is slashed repeatedly with a pen-knife, her legs are amputated with a hacksaw, and her stomach is gutted with a pair of hedge-clippers before she is cannibalized. The horrified Steve has his eye drilled out as the film ends with a voice-over stating that the murderers are now in jail. Although it is certainly repulsive, Last House on Dead End Street is not a real snuff film, as some rumors have claimed. The special effects are obviously low-rent, and not particularly convincing, but are vile enough to keep the film interesting. Among other sights awaiting brave viewers are: cows being bled to death in a slaughterhouse, a hunchback whipping a woman in blackface, a blind man being strangled, a woman branded with a hot iron before having her throat slashed, and a vicious beating. One of the more graphic examples of the Manson subgenre, this horror film is for specialized tastes only.

The film begins with the birth of twin girls to a Budapest mother (Dorothy Segda) in 1880. Orphaned early on, the girls are forced to sell matches on the streets until both are adopted by two separate families. Flash forward to 1900: Having lost track of one another, the grown-up twins take separate compartments on the Orient Express. One of the girls (Segda again) has become the pampered mistress of a wealthy man; the other (Segda yet again) is a bomb-wielding anarchist. Director Ildiko Enyedi evidently intended My 20th Century as an allegorical statement concerning the status of women in the modern mechanical age. The experiences of the twins are interspersed with shots of Thomas Edison (Peter Andorai), whom we see at the beginning of the film perfecting his incandescent light bulb on the very day that the sisters are born. The more technological advances made by Edison, the more confused the twins become in establishing their own roles in an advancing civilization. Adroitly avoiding cut-and-dried symbolism, Ildiko Enyedi keeps the audience wondering what shes up to by including such surrealistic vignettes as a caged chimpanzee recounting the day of his capture! ~ Hal Erickson, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Comedy, Drama",Ildikó Enyedi,Kino Lorber,104 minutes,"Dorota Segda, Oleg Yankovsky, Peter Andorai"

Director Woody Van Dyke, in the tradition of his White Shadows on the South Seas and Trader Horn, took his cast and crew on location to the Arctic, arriving by whaling schooner at the topmost settlement in Alaska with author Freuchen as his guide. Van Dyke, Freuchen, and cinematographer Ray Wise also played prominent on-screen roles in the film. Eskimo Ray Mala (billed only by his last name) essays the title role, speaking in the tongue of his ancestors (even though his English was excellent). Rather than use superimposed titles, Van Dyke resorted to old-fashioned silent-movie subtitles in several dialogue sequences. The story concentrates on the more exotic aspects of Eskimo life, notably the races (alleged) casual approach to sex. Though tribal leader Mala has, by his own admission, slept with 20 women without benefit of clergy, woe betide anyone who tries to steal his current sweetheart -- as a rapacious trader discovers when hes harpooned to death by the cuckolded hero. Mala is ultimately undone by the Canadian Mounties, whose efforts to civilize the Eskimo community result in a sudden and tragic shift of the balance of power. Editor Conrad A. Nervig won an Oscar for his Herculean efforts to bring cohesiveness to the story. Performing respectably at the box office, Eskimo inspired another location jaunt in 1935: Last of the Pagans, which also starred Ray Mala.",NR,"Action & Adventure, Classics, Drama",W.S.

Jenks moves into the facility in June 2005, with assistant director William Godel and cinematographer Quickmire Pettigrew in tow, who utilizes a tiny, unobtrusive 24p video camera to document the experience - thus achieving candor and intimacy. The film not only observes the aging process and the state of institutionalized care for the elderly (most of whom are octogenarians and nonagenarians) but studies the burgeoning (and utterly unexpected) cross-generational friendships that develop between Jenks and many of his newfound housemates. The film introduces us to such seniors as jocky 80-year-old Bill Delarm, who is initially introverted and laconic but who ultimately breaks down and becomes one of Jenkss best friends; 95-year-old Tammy Signorile, a devoted companion to two other women in the facility; blind Libby Smith; and Dotty Shepard, who sinks rapidly into debilitating illness over the course of the picture. Jenks includes many memorable sequences throughout, including an instance where the power in the home cuts out during a lightning storm, terrifying many residents. The final scenes of the picture witness Jenks departing with a firsthand, heightened knowledge of the elderly and a grave sadness at the thought of leaving his new friends behind - as well as a concern over their collective physical deterioration.

Though Russell was a classically trained composer and cellist with an almost encyclopedic knowledge of indigenous Indian music, this performer quickly branched off in a more offbeat and unusual direction. The Oskaloosa, IA, native fixated on such counterculture icons as John Cage and Timothy Leary at an early age, then ran away from home during adolescence and joined a Frisco-based Buddhist group. Russell became acquainted and associated with poet Allen Ginsberg, then moved to New York City, where (like Cage) he established himself as a veritable fixture in the underground music scene and worked as the music director for The Kitchen. By the mid-70s, Russell began producing prescient disco records in the pre-Gibb days, under colorful pseudonyms such as Indian Ocean and Loose Joints. Unfortunately, he never culled the devoted following that he deserved until about 15 years after his death. Wolf employs a fractured film-essay style throughout the film, intercutting such materials as archival footage, extracts of musical compositions by Russell, and revealing interviews with Russells family. Thematically, the director uses the tale of Russells colorful life as a springboard into investigations of broader subjects and themes including gay lifestyles in the early AIDS era, the sociocultural landscape of Manhattan (and the cultural underground) during the 1970s and 80s, and the importance of staking out new directions in art and music for an innovative mind such as Russells.",NR,"Documentary, Musical & Performing Arts, Special Interest",Matt Wolf,Plexifilm,71 minutes,"Bob Blank, Ernie Brooks, Steven Hall"

A narrative story unfolds within the context of the film but is embedded in divergent scenes of New York City and occasionally unrelated soundscapes that mesmerize the viewer. Writer/director Ben Speth creates the character of Alex to use as his subject in this study of random happenings called life. The story follows Alex, a thirty-eight-year-old dancer, as she goes through the motions of her day--drinks with a girlfriend, fighting with her boyfriend, dance rehearsal, infidelity--and effectively shows the discontent in her life. Anne Iobst plays Alex with such honesty and grace that you quickly forget that she is really a fictional character. Speth shows the events of Alexs day but does not go any further; thus, the end of the film is not the end of the story--life goes on. He successfully introduces experimentation and abstraction to the medium of motion pictures, which usually emphasizes control, structure, and complacency. Speths many unconventional techniques leave a good portion of the interpretation of Alex up to the viewer. Long, static camera shots beautifully capture life happening around New York City: Chinese teenagers playing handball, a subway station during rush hour, a city park on a sunny day.

If one is to believe the script of this made-for-cable film, Williams hadnt intended the Crips to wallow in crime and violence; instead, hed hoped that the gang would form a united front to protect his hood from other gangbangers. Needless to say, it didnt turn out that way, and within a few years of its 1971 formation, the Crips was the biggest and most powerful gang in the country, with branches in virtually every state. Ultimately, Williams is charged with murder and sentenced to San Quentins death row in 1987. There he experiences an epiphany and becomes an advocate for peace, harmony, and tolerance, writing childrens books that preach against the lure of street gangs. As the years roll by and the date of his execution draws closer, Williams manages to negotiate a peace between the Crips and their chief rivals, the Bloods, and even manages to receive three Nobel Prize nominations. Lynn Whitfield co-stars as Barbara Becnel, the crusading journalist who helped Williams see the light -- not so much to save his soul, but to prevent a similar fate from befalling her own son. Although considerable liberties are taken with the facts, Redemption: The Stan ""Tookie"" Williams Story neither glamorizes nor excuses its title character, nor the ""gangsta"" culture that he so enthusiastically embraced in his youth.

One of the more curious entries in this effort was The Negro Soldier. The structure of the film is that of a black minister who preaches a sermon to his all-black congregation. Over the course of 40 minutes, the minister recounts the contributions of blacks in American military history, from Crispus Attucks and the Boston Massacre to the men who served in WWI, along the way touching on the War of 1812, the Civil War, the exploration of the West and the building of the railroad, the Spanish-American War, and the building of the Panama Canal. Throughout, the filmmakers blend archival footage and Hollywood re-creations to illustrate the preachers words, and even include a re-creation of the destruction by the Nazis of a WWI monument in France to African-American soldiers.

However, things dont go well for Ray and Claude, and theyre arrested by a sheriff in Mississippi who recently killed a man and needs someone on whom he can hang the charge. Since Ray and Claude are black, from out of town and have been caught red-handed with a load of illegal liquor, the sheriff figures theyre easy pickings and frames them for the murder. Soon the two men are inmates in a Southern work camp, where they spend the next 55 years learning to get along with the other inmates, avoiding the wrath of the guards, seeing younger prisoners come and go and never losing hope that someday, somehow, their innocence will be proven and theyll be released.

Yet in lieu of presenting a chronological and all-inclusive account of Knefs decades-long career, Wessel and screenwriter Maria von Heland use Knefs 1966 concert at the Berlin Philharmonie as a narrative framing device from which they exclusively flash back to the years depicting the performers early ascent to stardom; the film thus ends as Knef is just beginning to achieve acclaim and recognition as a vocalist. The backstory commences in 1943, when 17-year-old Knef (Heike Makatsch) aspires to show business life. She applies for a job at Babelsberg Studios, under the aegis of casting director Else Bongers (Monica Bleibtreu) who becomes her lifelong mentor.

Shot mostly inside a speeding car, this tense and claustrophobic drama was filmed in 1974 (five years before Bavas death), but shortly before completion the death of one of the principal financiers threw the project into limbo. In 1998, the films elements were rediscovered and editing was completed using Bavas notes as a guide; the result is a film that takes a decidedly modern detour from Bavas traditional Gothic subject matter and gives a much broader perspective on the range of his talents. A few years later, the film was reworked and retitled Kidnapped for a brief theatrical run in the U.S. That version of the film would later be released on DVD by Anchor Bay, with the original, Rabid Dogs cut included as supplimental material.

751,33239,Delirium,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"Italian filmmaker Renato Polselli (aka Ralph Brown) wrote and directed this wonderfully sick and demented giallo thriller, a shining example of the sort of outrageous psychosexual perversity for which the genre has become cherished by cult enthusiasts. Former Mr. Universe Mickey Hargitay was already a sleaze favorite for his turn as Il Boio Scarlatto and his disingenuously tearful tour of his late wifes estate in The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield. Hargitay only solidifies that image here as Prof. Herbert Lyutak, a perverse sex maniac employed as a criminal psychologist. Lyutak is first seen giving a young woman a ride in his car, eventually attacking her and chasing her through the woods to a creek, where he beats her to death. Lyutaks wife (Rita Calderoni) finds his bloody shirt, but because there is another murder while the demented shrink is consulting the police, he is cleared. Working with the authorities, Lyutak has a family friend (Katia Kardinali) pose as a prostitute to catch the killer, but he simply murders another hooker not far away. The bodies continue piling up, with so many alibis and confusing contradictions that it soon becomes apparent the killings are the work of several hands. Polselli keeps the sleaze factor high throughout, notably in some psychedelic nightmare sequences featuring Lyutaks fantasies of torturing nude women in his basement and in the murder of Kardinali, which features some fairly graphic whipping and kinky sexual allusions. Theres also lesbianism, strangulation, and an interesting synth-rock score by Gianfranco Reverberi to keep viewers interested, and the ultimate conclusion is -- in keeping with the title -- a delirious, bloody battle between three psychopaths in a cellar. Thats only in the original version, however, because the American re-edit removed most of the sleaze, changed the setting from England to the United States, and added two extra murders and a police shootout, not to mention some dubious Vietnam flashbacks. The ultimate entertainment value to genre enthusiasts, therefore, is highly dependent on which version they see, as the extensive changes reduce a wild, flamboyant shocker to just another dull mystery.

Murnaus Sunrise represents the art of the wordless cinema at its zenith. Based on the Hermann Sudermann novel A Trip to Tilsit, this ""Song of Two Humans"" takes place in a colorful farming community, where people from the city regularly take their weekend holidays. Local farmer George OBrien, happily married to Janet Gaynor, falls under the seductive spell of Margaret Livingston, a temptress from The City. He callously ignores his wife and child and strips his farm of its wealth on behalf of Livingston, but even this fails to satisfy her. One foggy evening, OBrien meets Livingston at their usual swampland trysting place. She bewitches him with stories about the city -- its jazz, its bright lights, its erotic excitement. Thrilled at the prospect of running off with Livingston, OBrien stops short: ""What about my wife?"" Drawing ever closer to her victim, Livingston murmurs ""Couldnt she just...drown?"" (the subtitle bearing these words then ""melts"" into nothingness). In his delirium, the husband agrees. The plan is to row Gaynor to the middle of the lake, then capsize the boat. Gaynor will drown, while OBrien will save himself with some bulrushes that hed previously hidden in the boat; thus, the murder will look like an accident. The next day, the brooding OBrien begins slowly rowing his unsuspecting wife across the lake. Halfway to shore, he makes his intentions clear, but is unable to go through with it. As his wife cringes in terror, OBrien rows to the other side of lake. Once ashore, she runs away from him in terror, as he stumbles after her, trying to apologize. Gaynor boards a streetcar bound for the city, with OBrien climbing aboard a few seconds afterward. Upon reaching the city (a renowned set design), OBrien continues trying to make amends to his wife. They sit disconsolately at a table in a restaurant, unable to eat the plate of cake that is set before them. Slowly, Gaynor begins overcoming her fear. The couple wander into a church, where a wedding is taking place. Breaking down in sobs, OBrien begins repeating the wedding vows, thereby convincing Gaynor that she has nothing to fear. Together again, the couple embraces in the middle of a busy street, oblivious to the honking horns and irate motorists. Anxious to prove to each other that all is well, the husband and wife spend a delightful afternoon having their pictures taken and ""dolling up"" in a posh barber shop. They cap their unofficial second honeymoon at a joyous festival in an outsized amusement park. More in love with each other than ever before, OBrien and Gaynor head back across the lake in the dark of night. Suddenly, a storm arises. Pulling out the bulrushes with which hed planned to save himself, OBrien straps them onto Janet, telling her to swim to shore. The storm passes. Washing up on shore, the unconscious OBrien is brought home. But Gaynor is nowhere to be found, and it is assumed that she has died in the storm. Half-insane, OBrien strikes out at Livingston, the instigator of the murder plan. Just as he is about to throttle the treacherous temptress, he is summoned home; his wife is alive! As Livingston stumbles out of the village, OBrien and Gaynor cling tightly to one another, watching the sun rise above their now-happy home. Together with Seventh Heaven, Sunrise earned Janet Gaynor the first-ever Best Actress Academy Award, while Charles Rosher and Karl Struss walked home with the industrys first Best Photography Oscar.

The story, which centers on the dreams and romances of a sheet-music salesman named Arthur Parker (Bob Hoskins), is punctuated by musical numbers where the characters lip-sync to the original recording, providing the audience with a glimpse of the characters inner worlds. A dreamer who believes in the perfect world depicted in the pop songs, Arthur is frustrated by financial worries and a strained, sexless marriage. Seeking an escape, on a business trip he falls in love with a small-town teacher; pretending to be a wealthy songwriter, he courts her, and finds a kindred spirit. However, despite the promises of the love songs, they soon finds themselves headed towards further challenges and a potentially tragic end. Potter and director Piers Haggard create a unique sort of musical by using pre-existing songs and setting them in distinctly realistic contexts, contrasting the idealistic, carefree songs with the harsher economic, social, and interpersonal realities of the surrounding world. ~ Judd Blaise, Rovi",NR,"Drama, Musical & Performing Arts",Piers Haggard,nothing,nothing,"Bob Hoskins, Gemma Craven, Kenneth Colley"

Still, he is so valuable a player that the Cubs management hides the letters from his hometown sweetheart Nellie (Patricia Ellis), so that Elmer wont bolt the team and head for home. When Nellie comes to visit Elmer, she finds him in an innocent but compromising situation with a glamorous actress (Claire Dodd). She turns her back on him, and disconsolate Elmer tries to forget his troubles at a crooked gambling house. Elmer incurs an enormous gambling debt, which the casinos owner is willing to forget if Elmer will only throw the deciding World Series game. Elmer brawls with the gambler and lands in jail, where he learns of a particularly cruel practical joke that had previously been played on him. Out of spite, he refuses to play in the Big Game, and thanks to a jailhouse visit by the gamblers, it looks as though Elmer has taken a bribe. But when he shows up to play (after patching things up with Nellie), Elmer proves that hes been true-blue all along. Based on the Broadway play by Ring Lardner and George M. Cohan, Elmer the Great betrays its stage origins in its static early scenes, but builds confidently to a terrific climax during a rain-soaked ball game. This enjoyable film was the second in Joe E.

Katharine Hepburn and Doris Nolan play Linda and Julia Seton, two daughters of a very well-to-do family. Linda feels a bit lost in the shuffle as sister Julia prepares to marry self-made financier Cary Grant. Hepburn has always rebelled against her privileged trappings, and finds a kindred spirit in the unorthodox, iconoclastic Grant. On the verge of compromising his down-to-earth values with his marriage to the wealth-obsessed Nolan, Grant chooses instead to plight his troth with soul-mate Hepburn, celebrating his ""liberation"" by doing several cartwheels. Donald Ogden Stewart is careful to bring the pre-Depression frivolities of the Barry play up-to-date, first by changing the character of Grants best friend (played in both films by Edward Everett Horton) from a lazy socialite to a dedicated professor, and by including several lines indicating how out of touch the privileged classes are--and choose to remain--with 1930s realities. The only element in which the remake does not improve on the original is in the casting of Hepburns alcoholic younger brother; charming though Lew Ayres is in the 1938 film, he is still outclassed by Monroe Owsley in Holiday (1930). Katharine Hepburn managed to temporarily defray her ""box office poison"" onus when Holiday proved to be a success; alas, her next film, Bringing Up Baby (which reteamed her with Grant), was a financial bust, compelling her to return to Broadway--where she made a spectacular comeback in another Philip Barry play, +The Philadelphia Story.",NR,"Classics, Comedy, Drama, Romance",George Cukor,Sony Repertory,96 minutes,"Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Doris Nolan"

Wayne prays to an altar of Raven in his living room, then begins dressing like Santa Claus and murdering her female co-stars when he feels betrayed. Despite being full of the usual scenes of naked women being stabbed and rended with garden trowels, this film has a bit more on its mind. It is really the first comment by the Scream Queen industry on itself and the possibly dangerous fans who slaver over slick magazines and films that trade on women covered in blood, many of them feigning death. It is a disturbing subgenre, but one which director John Russo (editor of Scream Queens Illustrated) knows intimately, and it is comforting to see that he understands its potential downside. Mainstream horror fans should enjoy the film too, especially with cameos from Marilyn Eastman and Karl Hardman of Night of the Living Dead (which Russo co-wrote) and a fine lead performance by Rochon. When she recites monologues defending her career choices and worrying about some of her obsessive fans, she sounds as if she speaks from experience and delivers a message that many of her real-life fans need to hear.

The story begins with television reporter/anchor Karen White (Dee Wallace) taking part in a dangerous police operation intended to trap psychopath Eddie Quist (Robert Picardo). When confronted by Eddie face to face, she witnesses something horrifying enough to trigger selective amnesia. Plagued by a series of violent nightmares, Karen decides to admit herself to a posh recovery resort known only as ""The Colony,"" run by her eccentric New Age therapist, Dr. Waggner (Patrick MacNee), and brings along her husband, Bill (Christopher Stone), for support. The night after they arrive, Karen and Bill are unnerved by eerie howling in the woods. Back in the city, Karens co-workers Chris (Dennis Dugan) and Terry (Belinda Balaski) have been investigating Eddies background after discovering that his body has disappeared from the morgue. Sifting through Eddies possessions, they find a strange collection of artwork depicting wolf-like creatures, and decide to consult with Walter Paisley (Dick Miller, of course), the owner of an occult bookshop, on werewolf lore. Though he claims not to believe in the stuff hes selling, Paisley nevertheless convinces Chris to purchase a handful of silver bullets...just in case. Back at the colony, Dr. Waggner has organized a hunting party after hearing Karens account of the nocturnal howling, but the men find nothing but a rabbit, which Bill is told to bring to the cabin of the sultry Marsha (Elisabeth Brooks) to prepare for dinner. After resisting Marshas less-than-subtle sexual overtures, Bill is attacked by a wolf while returning to his cabin. The following moonlit night, the sleepless Bill wanders outside to find Marsha waiting and the two make love by the campfire, their bodies undergoing a frightening transformation. Just as Karen is beginning to suspect that her husband is hiding a secret far more threatening than marital infidelity, Chris and Terry have come to realize -- too late, in Terrys case -- that Eddie Quist is not only still alive, but not quite human...and he knows hes being followed. Chris arrives at the colony too late to save Terry, but manages to find Karen just as the colonys residents -- all of whom are werewolves, including Dr. Waggner -- are assembling to decide her fate. Dante fills his film with heartfelt homages to The Wolf Man and other classic horror movies, as well as a few clever visual puns and in-jokes from his tenure with Roger Corman, but never strays from the path to genuine horror, particularly when Rob Bottins chilling monsters are onscreen.","R (adult situations/language, nudity, violence)",Horror,Joe Dante,MGM Home Entertainment,91 minutes,"Dee Wallace, Patrick Macnee, Dennis Dugan"

The film opens as Monas frozen body is found in a drainage ditch and proceeds to tell her story in a series of flashbacks and semi-documentary style ""interviews"" with the people who have known Mona during the last few weeks of her life. Mona is a distant, independent and not-very-likeable woman who goes from place to place, living where she can and with anyone who will take her in. Monas true nature remains a puzzle, both to those who thought they knew her, and to the audience. As the movie progresses it becomes clear that no one knew the true Mona and she, because of her aloofness and essential coldness, provided a canvas for those she met to write upon. Who Mona really was, and what she thought remains ambiguous. Sandrine Bonnaire is excellent as Mona, making an unappealing and cold character interesting and intriguing. Director Agnes Varda began her career as a still photographer. This beginning is evident in her elegant framing of the film. She has an instinctive awareness of and a photographers eye for visual detail which makes the film cold, bleak, and aridly beautiful. Internationally acclaimed, Vagabond is Vardas most successful film. ~ Linda Rasmussen, Rovi","R (adult situations/language, nudity)","Art House & International, Drama",Agnès Varda,Pacific Arts Video,105 minutes,"Sandrine Bonnaire, Macha Méril, Stephane Freiss"

When Amy fell seriously ill, as her dream predicted, she went on a search to change that dream, leading her to eminent neuroscientist Mark Solms, and to new understanding of the complexity of our brains.

Custer even goes so far as to promise Chief Crazy Horse (Anthony Quinn) that the white man will never set foot in the sacred Black Hills. Alas, Custer is betrayed by greedy gold prospectors, whipped into a frenzy by scheming (and fictional) land speculator Ned Sharp (Arthur Kennedy). Forced by circumstances to do battle against Crazy Horse to prevent tribal retaliation, Custer and his command ride towards a rendezvous with destiny at the Little Big Horn on June 25, 1876. Though some of the historical inaccuracies in the film are real howlers, blame cannot be laid solely at the feet of Warner Bros.; the Custer legend had previously been perpetrated by the generals loyal widow Elizabeth Bacon (played herein by Olivia de Havilland), then eagerly elaborated upon by Eastern news journalists and dime novels. This film represented the final screen pairing of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland, a fact that lends poignancy to their classic parting scene. Though an extremely long film, They Died With Their Boots On is never dull, especially during the spectacular Custers Last Stand finale.",NR,"Classics, Drama, Western",Raoul Walsh,WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES,141 minutes,"Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Arthur Kennedy"
1373,34145,Demonia,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,nothing,"Italian cult favorite Lucio Fulci (Zombi 2) directed this atmospheric return to the Gothic themes which had brought him such success in the early 80s, and reminds the viewer of a pair of those early works in the opening scenes. Beginning with the horrifying torture, crucifixion, and flaming deaths of a group of nuns beneath a convent in 1486 Sicily (reminiscent of the opening murder of the warlock in LAldila), the film then flashes forward to modern-day Toronto, where Liza (Meg Register) has visions of their deaths at a séance (as in the opening of Paura nella Citta dei Morti-Viventi). Naturally, Liza soon finds herself in Sicily, along with archaeologist Professor Paul Evans (Brett Halsey) and his colleague, Porter (Al Cliver). Nosing around the convent, she breaks open the crypt, unleashing the nuns expectedly bloody occult vengeance. People are impaled on spikes, a woman (Carla Cassola) has her eyes ripped out by her pet cats, a mean butcher (Lino Salemme) has a meathook driven through his neck and his tongue nailed to a board, and so on. Things reach a predictable frenzy with an angry mob, a nun with no face, demonic possession, and a man ripped completely in two. Theres also a bizarre back story about the nuns seducing local youths and murdering them at the moment of orgasm to obtain their blood for Satanic rituals. None of it makes much sense, and most fans of the director seeking a return to form found Demonia a pale imitation of his notorious Gothics, particularly coming so soon after Michele Soavis similar -- and more successful -- La Chiesa. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi",NR,"Anime & Manga, Art House & International, Horror",Lucio Fulci,nothing,nothing,"Carla Cassola, Al Cliver, Lucio Fulci"

Marie (Anouk Grinberg) has no real need for a pimp, being a self-reliant, unabashed woman so fond of her job as a hooker that she is able to convince strangers to try it themselves. Indeed, her financial success allows her to take care of Jeannot (Gérard Lanvin), an impoverished vagrant whom she finds on the streets. She provides him with a bath and a place to sleep, and the two rapidly become lovers. Nevertheless, Marie is soon imploring Jeannot to act as her pimp, begging him to slap her around and take her money. He takes to his new role and soon decides to talk a manicurist (Valeria Bruni Tedeschi) into becoming the next member of his stable. The newcomers inexperience proves to be his downfall, however, as the manicurist lands him in trouble with the law. Director Bertrand Blier attempts to create a controversial look at sexuality by combining black comedy with scenes of smoky sensuality, though many critics found the central premise and the presentation of Maries contradictory, masochistic character too unconvincing for the film to be fully successful. ~ Judd Blaise, Rovi",NR,"Art House & International, Comedy, Drama",Bertrand Blier,nothing,98 minutes,"Anouk Grinberg, Gérard Lanvin, Valeria Bruni Tedeschi"

He is taken captive on the battlefield by brigands, but escapes and flees into the desert. Saved from starvation by Hasan, a mysterious Muslim traveler, he returns the favor when Hasan is attacked by outriders of Saladins army. The two take refuge in an isolated oasis, the home of Soheila, widow of a Muslim warrior, and Soheila nurses the severely wounded Hasan back to health.While he waits for Hasans injuries to heal, Rene finds himself tempted by the simple pleasures of a life free from the ravages of war. His growing attraction for Soheila, followed by news of the atrocities committed by both the Christian and Muslim armies, lead him to question his vows of chastity and obedience and his commitment to the Crusader ethos. But the secret that Hasan harbors brings down on the little oasis the wrath of Saladins forces, igniting a confrontation that has devastating consequences -- consequences which finally hold the answers for his troubled soul. -- © Official Site",NR,"Art House & International, Classics, Drama",David Hogan,Anthem Pictures,94 minutes,"Mapi Galán, Tim Abell, Scott Cleverdon"

An Englishman (Chaplin) cons a newspaper reporter (Henry Lehrman) out of some money. The Englishman flirts with a young woman who later turns out to be the reporters girlfriend, and the reporter and the Englishman fight. Later, the Englishman talks his way into a job at the same newspaper where the reporter works. When the reporter takes some photos of an automobile accident as it happens, the reporter and the Keystone Kops help the driver, and the Englishman steals the photos. He rushes them back to the paper, and they are immediately put in the latest edition. The newspaperman catches up with him, and they begin fighting in the street, and the film ends as a streetcar cowcatcher sweeps them up. Chaplin is barely recognizable in this film, sporting a monocle, a top hat, and a walrus moustache. While this costume had been used in his stage appearances, he quickly realized that it was not appropriate for a film comedian. He would devise his famous costume of the tramp in his next film Mabels Strange Predicament. Chaplin was unhappy when he saw the finished film because many of the gags that he had performed had been cut out by Lehrman, the director.

The story is told within the framework of three men waiting at a railway station. A con-man (Edward G. Robinson) listens to the account of a trial held recently in the town as told by a prospector (Howard Da Silva) and a preacher (William Shatner) suffering from a crisis of faith in humanity. Three witnesses at the trial of a Mexican outlaw give conflicting testimony. Each version is shown in flashback. The outlaw, Juan Carrasco (Paul Newman), confesses that he bound the husband (Laurence Harvey), raped the wife, and killed the husband in a duel of honor. The wife (Claire Bloom) claims that the outlaw raped her, and then she stabbed her husband when he contemptuously blamed her for inviting the assault. The third witness, an old Indian (Paul Fix), declares that he found the dying husband who stated that he stabbed himself because he couldnt live with the humiliation. At this point, the narrative is interrupted by an abandoned babys cry. The child has gold hidden in his clothing which the con-man attempts to appropriate. Then the discussion of the trial continues, turning brusquely from drama to parody. The prospector admits that he witnessed the rape, but that the wife nagged the two men into fighting over her. The husband tripped and fell on his own knife. The prospector, who stole the jeweled knife from the dead body, chose not to appear in court. Possibly out of some desire for redemption, the prospector decided to care for the abandoned baby, and the preacher regains faith from the supposed altruistic action. The eerily deserted train station and the strong black-and-white cinematography contribute a mild surreal quality to the film, but can do little to save the story from its flaws. The changes in the characters necessary to accommodate the new setting cause them to lose important symbolic significance in the translation. Despite a star cast and strong acting, the new version is mediocre at best.

Brook was responsible for the staging of this 1953 version, but it was Andrew McCullough who put it to film. Orson Welles portrays the titular character, one of the most memorable and important characters from the Shakespearean canon. The story begins with the famous request Lear makes of his daughters: to express how much they love him. In exchange, Lear will divide his land and power amongst them based on the extent of their answers. Cordelia (Natasha Parry), the youngest and the one whom Lear loves the most, answers very modestly -- yet honestly --and incurs the wrath of Lear, who not only withholds his gift to her, but banishes her as well. Lear divides his lands and power between the two older daughters, Goneril (Beatrice Straight) and Regan (Margaret Phillips), who intend to take swift and complete control of their fathers power almost instantaneously. Lear is reduced to an angry, bitter man who realizes too late what has happened. After a series of indignities are inflicted upon him by his daughters, he retreats into a storm, vowing revenge. This film is an above-average adaptation with a very capable cast and a well-staged presentation.

But what was he like before he formed the Nazi party? Screenwriter and director Menno Meyjes explores that question in this drama, a work of fiction keyed to the fact that Hitler unsuccessfully pursued a career as an artist following World War I. In 1918, Max Rothman (John Cusack) is a former artist who lost an arm during the war. While Max can no longer create, his eye for talent is as keen as ever, so he has become a successful art dealer, specializing in Modernists such as George Grosz. Maxs success has brought him a fine home and a beautiful wife, Nina (Molly Parker); hes also acquired a mistress, Liselore (Leelee Sobieski), a lovely young woman with artistic aspirations of her own. One day, Max meets Adolf Hitler (Noah Taylor), an emotionally intense, fellow war veteran who has found himself penniless in Munich. Adolf fancies himself an artist, and while Max isnt especially impressed with his technique, he sees in him a burning passion and a desire to communicate, so he encourages Adolf to express his demons through his art. While Adolf takes Maxs advice to heart and strikes up a friendship with him, Maxs friends find Adolfs open advocation of anti-Semitism rather troubling; Max, who is Jewish, simply chalks Adolfs attitudes up to unpleasant wartime experiences. But as Adolf immerses himself more deeply into his political interests and his thoughts on social engineering, he begins to leave painting behind in favor of a more interesting art form, the political arena. Max marked the first directorial effort of noted screenwriter Meyjes.",R (for language),Drama,Menno Meyjes,Lions Gate Films,109 minutes,"John Cusack, Noah Taylor, Leelee Sobieski"

Yuri Tolubeyev co-stars as Sancho Panza -- and if Sancho sounds a bit like Sherlock Holmes Dr. Watson at times, it is because his voice was dubbed for the English-language version by Howard Marion-Crawford, who portrayed Watson on the 1954 TV series Sherlock Holmes. The film follows the path laid out three centuries earlier by Miguel de Cervantes, stopping short of Cervantes original ending, which intimated that Quixote would never die (this was not in keeping with Communist ideology of the period). In this version, Quixote jousts with imaginary giants and mistakes milkmaids for aristocrats against the backdrop of the Crimea, standing in for the hills of Spain.

When the plant begins malfunctioning, the towns leaders summon the designer, David Harrison (Jim Metzler), to look into the problem. Soon after Harrison and his wife Sarah (Morgan Brittany) arrive, however, they find themselves in the thick of an escalating rivalry between two vampire factions -- one led by peaceful Count Mardulak (David Carradine), who ordered the blood plant as part of his plan to integrate the dying vampire race into human society; and the old-school bloodsuckers, under the sinister Jefferson (John Ireland), who consider Mardulak and his followers traitors to their predatory heritage. While the Harrisons fates hang in the balance, the scales are jostled further by the arrival of a man named Van Helsing (Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell, in a surprisingly low-key performance), descendant of the legendary vampire hunter, whose disorganized efforts at wiping out towns undead populace are impeded by his growing attraction to a pretty young vampire (Deborah Foreman). With tongue firmly in cheek, this semi-parody plays off audiences familiarity with the conventions of the vampire genre, but it seldom sacrifices creepiness and suspense when needed.

To convert their love story into a love marriage, the couple faces a tough battle in front of them. For it is easy to fight and rebel, but much harder to convince. Will Krish and Ananyas love for each other sustain the battles? Will they manage to convince their parents and make it to their wedding?
