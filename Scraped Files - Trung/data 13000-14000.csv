Attempting to warn his friend, he tells his grim story, which unfolds via flashback. It all began five years ago when he met and fell in love with her on a train.

His nagging, over-bearing mother disapproves of the affair and for good reason. Soon the woman takes the smitten Don Pasqual for everything and then demands more.

Later, after restoring his fortune, he finds her dancing in a bar in Cadiz. Once again he gives her everything he has, and again she leaves. And so it goes. The younger fellow is impressed by the story and promises to try and stay away from her, but like his friend he too is weak and in the end, tragedy for one of the men ensues.

We still don't know after this inconclusive, and shallow investigation into the seedier depths of Punk.",33%,21,38%,203,"12th October 1978. Room 100, the Chelsea Hotel - a faded 19th century faÃ§ade masking, a clientele of junkies. The floor of the tiny en-suite bathroom is covered in blood. And, slumped between the toilet and the sink is the body of a woman, peroxide blonde in black bra and panties. She is Nancy Spungen, a twenty year old, heroin addicted, former stripper, prostitute and groupie. She also has the accolade of being Sid Vicious girlfriend, to add to her crimes! A trail of blood leads to the bedroom where an NYPD detective - watched by his partner and six uniform officers - is slapping the aforementioned Sid, until minutes ago out cold on a concoction of drugs that might have killed a horse, across the face. He comes round. And seeing hes got an audience, gives way to bravado: ""Go on, arrest me. Im a dog, a dirty dog. I did it and I deserve everything I get, shoot me, kill me!"" Sid was arrested and charged with the murder but the case never came to trial and many questions remained unanswered. His guilt unproven and his innocence proclaimed. Alan G Parker sets out on his journey to discover the truth. Nancy is a regular on the punk scene with a talent for giving great blow jobs and a taste for musicians and heroin. Legend has it that she slept with every member of one major band, in one night! The men use her then lose her. The women brand her ""Nauseating Nancy"". But Nancys determined, ballsy. She knows what she wants and shell do anything to make sure she gets it. When the Heartbreakers leave for London on tour, Nancy follows and washes up at SEX, the Kings Road clothes shop run by McLaren and his girlfriend, Vivienne Westwood looking for Jerry Nolan, the drummer in the Heartbreakers Sids debut is at the Notre Dame Hall, just off Leicester Square. Dressed in trainers, jeans with the knees ripped out and a Vive Le Rock T-shirt and a brand new Fender Precision bass, he looks every inch the star. He hogs the mic. He steals the limelight. Watching, in the audience is a bottle blonde in black jeans, a black leather jacket, studded belt and a string mohair jumper bought from SEX: Nancy. She is accompanied by Linda Ashby, a junkie prostitute and already a Sex Pistols insider. Nancy and Sid wake up in bed together. Its morning, 11am - and this girl hasnt left yet. Sid thinks she must be his girlfriend. And from that day on, she is. Friends remember the birth of the co-dependent relationship of this modern day Romeo and Juliet that could only end one way: badly. Its 1977 - Jubilee year, the Pistols at their height sacked by A&M Records and picked up by Virgin in a matter of weeks, they achieve the worlds first banned number 1 single - and the inseparable Sid and Nancy are joined at the hip, living on a diet of sex, punk and heroin. There are fights. Sid downs a bottle of vodka, turns to the heroin and tries to throw himself out of a third floor hotel window. Nancy saves him by grabbing his belt. Shes thanked when he takes out his frustrations on the hotel furnishings and her. A few short months and a disastrous US tour later, the band is finished. The victims of too much to soon, and their own now growing egos. Sid returns home to Nancy and heroin. They hole themselves up in a love-nest in Pindock Mews. Steve Dior, the only surviving member of Sids solo group, remembers going round for dinner - ""I didnt know you could ruin fish fingers and beans, but she managed it"". Domestic bliss it is not. When Dead on Arrival director Lech Kowalski turns up to the flat to film Sid and Nancy, all he gets is footage of them lounging in bed, Sid in sunglasses and barely conscious, clutching a scotch and coke and Nancy lighting his cigarettes and finishing his sentences. They look like corpses in waiting. McLaren is trying to keep the idea of the Sex Pistols alive with Sid as front man. With Nancy in tow, they go to Paris. Sid records his iconic version of My Way. But hes a physical wreck and almost impossible to work with. Nancy has other plans anyway. She usurps McLaren as Sids manager. Sid and Nancy put together a show with the help of Glen Matlock, the man Sid replaced in the Sex Pistols. His fellow Rich Kid Steve New and Rat Scabies. The Vicious White Kids play an amazing one-off gig. Sid and Nancy pocket the proceeds and head to America. Sid and Nancy unpack in room 100 of New Yorks Chelsea Hotel - Sids gold records, a Never Mind the Bollocks poster and an innocuous-looking Fairy Liquid bottle. In it is the couples stash of Methadone and Nancys scrapbook, filled with cuttings on the legend that is and can only be - their own. Sids gigs are getting him a reputation. Hes out of it, cutting himself, getting bloody. Backstage, Nancy takes her revenge on the US crowd that had shut her out before she went to England, jealously controlling contact with Sid, not letting those whod shunned her anywhere near her very own rock star. For the first time in her life, shes in charge. 12th October, 1978. Room 100, the Chelsea Hotel. The Never Mind the Bollocks poster unpacked that summer is littered with needles. Sids gold discs are spattered with blood. And Sid is being led away by the NYPD. Hes taken from the hotel to be arraigned at a New York courthouse. As the New York Post of 13th October 1978 had it: Sid Vicious, bass guitarist of Britains spitting and stomping Sex Pistols Punk Rock band, yesterday was arrested and charged with stabbing his sultry blond girlfriend to death in their room at Manhattans famed Chelsea Hotel. His face pale and scratched, the dazed-looking Vicious muttered curses and ""Ill smash your cameras"" as he was led from the hotel. In court, Sid rests his head on a table and shudders throughout the 10-minute hearing. He is taken to the tough Rikers Island prison, photographed for ID, and locked in a cell to await his trial. And begin detoxification. What happened in the hours that preceded his arrest? Did Sid really kill Nancy? And, if he didnt, who did? The official story goes like this. Sid and Nancy spent the night doing drugs with friends. When they were alone, they fought. Sid took one of his knives and stabbed Nancy in the abdomen then passed out as she bled to death. When the police arrived, Sid confessed. Alan Parkers first witness is Steve Dior, Sids former band mate. Sid might have ""confessed"" when he was slapped conscious by the NYPD but from that day to the day he died, Sid swore he hadnt killed Nancy. Dior remembers Sids insistence when he asked him point blank if hed done it: ""I didnt do it! I didnt kill her! I didnt kill Nancy!"" Its a view shared by other friends of Sid. If they knew one thing about Sid Vicious, it was that he loved Nancy Spungen. But their drug-fuelled life together had been violent. So he loved her, but did that prove he didnt kill her? An autopsy on Nancys body confirmed that she had died from a single stab wound to the abdomen. Shed been stabbed some time between 6am and 7am and died some time between 9am and 10am. The doctors reports of the time said she would have survived between two and three hours after being stabbed. But the police team investigating Nancys murder had overlooked some important evidence: a bottle of Tuinol tablets and some brown flaky powder and three hypodermic needles. They were discovered hours later. Expert opinion insists that the dose of Tuinol that Sid took would have knocked him out cold. Doctors at the time estimated hed been unconscious for five hours or more. Sid came round sometime around 9.30am when he found the body and raised the alarm. According to the experts, he must have been unconscious since, at the latest, 4.30am. If Nancy was stabbed between 6am and 7am, then Sid couldnt have done it. One of the witnesses to the circumstances around Nancys demise was Neon Leon Webster, a singer/songwriter and drug addict who was in room 119 with his girlfriend when Sid and Nancy were said to have visited them at 9.45pm the night before Nancy turned up dead. The version of events Neon Leon gave to the police not only does not stack up but is different to the version of events he gave to the New York Post twelve hours later, which is different again to the version he told the Soho Weekly News a few days after the murder! So with the police case founded on unreliable testimony and experts prepared to say Sid couldnt physically have done it, who did kill Nancy - and why? To take Deep Throats advice to Watergate investigators Woodward and Bernstein - follow the money. Sid and Nancy, not the sort to have bank accounts, had just been paid $20,000 in cash by Virgin Records for the royalties due to Sid for My Way. They hadnt made much of a dent in it yet, so on the night of Nancys murder, most of the cash was sitting in the bedside cabinet in their hotel room. Friends and witnesses who were there in the hours before Nancys body was found remember seeing it. By morning, it was gone. So whoever did kill Nancy had quite a motive... Alan Parkers investigations over the past 22 years have led him to the door of a number of suspects and plenty of evidence that it is likely that Sid did not kill Nancy. Stanley Bard, the Chelsea Hotel manager, bears them out too. And James Merberg, the lawyer hired by McLaren and Virgin Records, to defend Sid believes that if he had made it to trial, Sid would have been acquitted. So that was that. Only Sid is in Rikers Island prison and the police and press think theyve got their man. Case closed. McLaren posts the $25,000 bail. Sid is released into the care of his mother, Anne, and books into The Deauville, a low-rent welfare hostel on Madison Avenue. Sids upbeat, telling McLaren and his mother how his fellow inmates at Rikers loved the Sex Pistols. He was ""Big Charlie Potatoes"" in there. McLaren plans a change of image - clean living, keep fit. But Anne has trouble selling it to her punk legend son. A month later, Sid gives his last UK television interview to Bernard Clarke on BBCs Nationwide. ""Where would you like to be?"" Clarke asks Sid. ""Under the ground."" ""Are you serious?"" ""Oh yeah."" Sid is hanging out with friends - among them Peter Kodick, Steve Dior and Eileen Polk. Theres a new girl too - Michelle Robinson, Sids going to clubs, drinking and popping pills. One night in a Manhattan disco called Hurrahs, he gets into a row with a man called Todd Smith, who takes exception to Sid trying to chat up his girlfriend. Theres a fight. Theres the sound of smashing glass. Peter grabs Sid and makes a human chain behind him. They get out before the police arrive. But Sid finds himself straight back in Rikers. There, he composes poetry about Nancy and mails them to her mother. Those letters from prison changed Deborah Spungens opinion of Sid Vicious. Elsewhere the tide was turning too. Merberg was building a strong defence. McLaren was on his way back to America, ready to look out for Sid on his expected release on bail, with an album deal under one arm. But events took over. Sids released from prison before McLaren can get there - and handed like a parcel to his mother, Anne. They arrive at 63 Bank Street: Michelles flat. Eileen Polk is there. Howie Pyro and Jerry Only, friends of Sids show up. They sit on the bed and listen to Sids tales from Rikers. Then Jerry Nolan and his girlfriend arrive. Sid and Jerry start pestering Anne for money for drugs. Dinner is cooking. Sid plays air guitar to the New York Dolls. They eat. But then Peter Kodick and a friend turn up just before midnight. People start wandering around the flat looking for spoons. Its not long before the guests are once again around Sids bed but this time hes overdosing. They walk him round the flat, fret about whether to call an ambulance. They dont. With Sid just about ok, the guests leave Anne, Sid and Michelle in the flat with a warning to keep Sid away from the rest of the heroin. By morning, Sid Vicious is face down and naked on his bed. At 21 years old. He is dead. NYPD records show that the heroin seized on the streets on New York that winter was cut down to between 32% and 36% pure. But Peter Kodick remembers that the wrap hed bought for Sid that night was nearly 100% pure. The Rolling Stones were in town and Keith Richards didnt entertain anything that wasnt pure or practically uncut. Sergeant Richard Houseman, the first officer on the scene, recalls seeing two women in the flat. The younger - Michelle Robinson - was hysterical, the older - Anne Beverley - eerily calm. On February 7th 1979, Simon John Beverley that became John Simon Ritchie that was Sid Vicious was cremated after a low-key service in New Jersey. That same day, Anne Beverley, pulls up at the guarded gates of St Davids cemetery in Philadelphia carrying her sons ashes. She cant get past the walls and the security. It starts to snow as she walks back to the car. But Anne hasnt left. She is driven to the back of the cemetery, climbs the wall and scatters the ashes on Nancys grave. It is at this graveside in St Davids Jewish Cemetery on the outskirts of Philadelphia, where Nancy Spungen - her hair dyed back to its natural chestnut brown, in her green high-school prom dress - was laid to rest aged 20 by her mother and where the 21-year-old Sid Vicious ashes were scattered by his own mother. And it is here where Alan Parkers story comes to an end. Before she took a fatal pills overdose in 1996, Anne Beverley wrote to Alan Parker. In her letter, she asked him to prove that her son was innocent. 30 years later Who Killed Nancy pulls together all of the evidence on the story of Sid and Nancy. --Â© Official Site",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest",Alan G.

While paying respects to his father and the latters business partner, dithering fuss-budget Peyton Potter (Edward Everett Horton), at the Club New Yorker, he spots chorus girl Eadie Allen (Alice Faye) and turns on the charm and all of the allure that the neer-do-well son of a Wall Street millionaire can muster. That, however, doesnt impress Eadie, who ignores his invitation so she can do her patriotic bit helping servicemen at the Stage Door Canteen (or, as its called here, the ""Broadway Canteen""). Realizing how down to earth and genuine she is -- exactly the kind of girl who doesnt care about his money or social position -- Andy shows a bit of the boyish innocence he has hidden beneath the arrogance that comes from his background of wealth and privilege, and also some humility, hiding that background and his real name. Before the night and their ""date"" on the Staten Island Ferry are over, theyre genuinely in love with each other, but that presents a problem -- since age 12, Andy has been unofficially ""engaged"" to Potters daughter Vivian (Sheila Ryan), who expects to marry him, and he cant quite bring himself to hurt Vivian by telling her that hes met someone else. Flash forward a few months, and Andy is on his way home on leave, a hero in the Pacific, and his father is so proud that he has to do something special to honor him, trying to rent out the Club New Yorker for a party but discovering that its closed for rehearsals of a new production. Suddenly, his fatherly devotion, patriotism, and Wall Street experience all click together -- he brings the entire performing company, plus Benny Goodmans band, up to his and Potters adjoining estates in Westchester to stage their act for his upscale neighbors and friends as part of the biggest War Bond rally ever seen (minimum admission a new 5,000-dollar War Bond), and in the process giving his son the biggest party hes ever seen. This leads to more comic turns for Hortons Potter, as a man who would make coffee nervous -- especially around show people -- but delights his ex-dancer wife (Charlotte Greenwood). Thats also how Eadie and Vivian end up at the Potter mansion together, comparing notes on their remarkably similar respective fiancÃ©s.
