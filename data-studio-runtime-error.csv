0,0,Houseguest,"Perplexingly unfunny given the involvement of its two hilarious leads, Houseguest wears out its welcome almost immediately.",14%,21,55%,11131,"Sinbad offers some unusual advice on how to make friends in this wacky comedy. Kevin Franklin (Sinbad) is a guy who dreams of starting his own business. However, getting it off the ground is another matter altogether, and soon Kevin discovers that the two loan sharks who fronted him money want to be paid, and paid promptly, otherwise Kevin will be spending some time in the hospital. On the run through an airport, Kevin is trying to find a way out when he overhears Gary Young (Phil Hartman) wondering where his friend is. It seems that Gary has arranged a reunion with an old friend from childhood, but since he hasnt seen him in 25 years, he has no idea what he looks like today, beyond the fact that hes black. Kevin fits the bill that far and claims to be Garys long lost buddy, which Gary buys hook, line, and sinker. Gary seems to enjoy bonding with his old friend, and Kevin likes staying at Garys fine home (and raiding his large icebox), but Kevin discovers that impersonating a stranger is a lot more complicated than he expected after hes forced to perform oral surgery and give a speech at a grade school ""Career Day"" presentation.

Plummer is Eunice, a tattooed, schizophrenic free spirit who is wandering in search of her recently departed lover, Judith. She leaves one gas station attendant dead when the person admits to not being Judith. But when she meets Miriam (Reeves), another gas station attendant who longs for love and attention, Eunice doesnt ask the fatal question. Strangely captivated by the eccentric woman, Miriam spends the night with Eunice and falls under her peculiar charm, Calling each other ""Eu"" and ""Mi,"" they hit the road, where they murder anyone who gets in their way. Both women sense that their actions will ultimately bring about a tragic end, but their dedication to their cause (rebelling against men who trivialize and demean women everywhere) and their love for one another gives them the strength to carry on. Though Plummers Eunice seems to have the upper hand through most of the film, it is the sacrifice that ""Mi"" makes for ""Eu"" that catches and holds the viewer at the conclusion of this bizarre little tale. ~ Don Kaye, Rovi",R,"Art House & International, Comedy, Drama",Michael Winterbottom,N/A,85 minutes,"Amanda Plummer, Saskia Reeves, Paul Bown"

The hilarious ""Opera Pathetique"" finale finds Nelson Eddy narrating the story of Willy, ""The Whale Who Wanted to Sing at the Met"". Better in its individual components than its sum total, Make Mine Music was drubbed by critics, who felt that Disney had abandoned his ""artistic"" aspirations in favor of crass commercialism, but performed reasonably well at the box office, inspiring several more ""omnibus"" animated features.

This film was shot between 1931 and 1933 on the Aran Islands, west of Irelands Galway Bay. Flahertys screen ""family"" was actually composed of three unrelated islanders chosen for their photogenic appeal: Colman ""Tiger"" King is the title character, a no-nonsense fisherman, Maggie Dirrane plays his wife, and Michael Dillane his young son. Flaherty is more interested in recording the natural beauty of the islands, which are largely rock, and the surrounding sea than in presenting any formal information on the lives of the islanders. Life here is as elemental as it was for the Eskimos in Nanook and the South Seas islanders in Moana. Though the film came under fire from some critics at the time of its release for not presenting the social conditions that hampered the lives of the islanders -- many of them renting from absentee landlords indifferent to their economic well-being -- it has come to be accepted as work of film poetry rather than a social document. ~ Tom Wiener, Rovi",NR,"Documentary, Special Interest",Robert J.
